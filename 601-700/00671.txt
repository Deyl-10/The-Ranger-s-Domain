Chapter 671: Someone Troublesome

Chapter 671: Someone troublesome

When Ryan and Femradiel stepped into the open meeting room, both of them couldn't help but look with a dubious eye at that man. He didn't look like a warrior per se, but he was wearing some pieces of light armor here and there, and those were emanating a lot of mana. Aside from the armor, he had some pieces of fur covering his body it was quite a weird combination considering that they were floating above a massive desertic area. What impressed Ryan even more, was the unnatural color in that guy's eyes. One could almost ignore the glint of madness that he had in those green eyes since they almost looked transparent, like some sort of crystal that was probably a characteristic that all those who had high levels of divinity possess: strange-looking eyes.

"Nice to meet you, my name is Loki," The redhead man said. "I am the father of the wolf that almost ripped you to shreds. I hope that we can leave that behind."

Ryan heard that Fenrir was Loki's son, but he never wondered how come a guy who looked like a human could be the father of a wolf. Regardless, Loki offered a handshake, but Ryan stepped backward. Despite his words, the glint in Loki's eyes made Ryan feel that he could be stabbed at any moment.

"Sure, why not?" Ryan asked.

Ryan looked at the other side of the room, and then he saw two women sitting on some chairs. One of them was dark-skinned and was wearing a long skirt, and her upper half, Ryan also saw a golden breastplate that protects her vitals. That was probably Isis, and she had short black hair and ember eyes she also that weird transparent glow in her eyes.

The other woman had light-brown long hair, but her eyes were blue, almost exactly like Poseidon's. She also had a glint of seriousness and caution in her eyes she probably was an ever so serious person just like him. However, unlike Poseidon, who never used a single piece of armor, that one was wearing a full plate golden armor. The only part that the armor wasn't protecting was her face, and that was because her helmet was on the table in front of her. It was weird to come full-armored to a meeting. It was even weirder than a golden round shield, and a massive sword that was as big as her was resting behind her chair.

As expected of goddesses their beauty was on a whole different level. Regardless, it looked like they waited for some sort of reaction coming from Ryan, but he didn't do anything. Still, they frowned when Femradiel covered his eyes.

"Don't stare too much," Femradiel said.

" My name is Ryan," Ryan said. "So, for what reason I am here?"

"Well, before that, I need to introduce you Athena," Isis said. "Greek goddess of wisdom, handicraft, and warfare."

"What's up, Athena?" Ryan said.

While Ryan wasn't as crazy as Loki looked like, he also disliked that stiff atmosphere of introductions, so he said that. But in the end, her left eye twitched it seemed she disliked Ryan's overly familiar greeting.

"Please sit," Isis said. "This might take a while. You too, Loki."

"Nah, I am fine here," Loki said and then sat on the border of the meeting room.

As if she had imagined that Femradiel would come, there were five chairs in the meeting room. After sitting down, Ryan crossed his arms and then waited for the start of the meeting. Still, Femradiel broke the serious atmosphere once more by moving her chair a bit closer to Ryan. At that point in time, he couldn't help but wonder if someone took her place after absorbing her memories.

"I heard that you used Poseidon to craft a weapon," Athena suddenly said. "Can I see it?"

"Why?" Ryan asked.

"After his defeat, he needs to at least to know who was working behind the scenes to cause his downfall," Athena said. "He is my uncle, and even though I hate him, he deserves that."

Ryan pondered if he should show her the weapon or not. Truth to be told, Ryan had not a single reason to trust Athena and Loki. Loki goes without saying since he is the Nordic god of trickery and mischief. Anyone who decides to trust a god of trickery and mischief wishes to be stabbed in the back. Regardless, if Ryan was going to be betrayed by them, it would be better to happen sooner than later. So, he summoned the crossbow and put it on the table.

"Athena I always knew that you would betray us sooner than later," Poseidon said.

"Hello, uncle," Athena said. "If you knew that, why didn't you make some preparations to avoid it? No, you did it, didn't you? But your preparations didn't take accounts the humans, you never imagined that one of them would defeat you."

"I will return one day and then murder all of you as brutally as possible," Poseidon said.

"You can't return he can't return, right?" Ryan asked.

"He can return," Isis replied. "If the weapon breaks and he has amassed enough energy to rebuild his body, he will be able to return with the same level of power as before. One of the reasons we called you here was to explain that. Keep that weapon well-hidden and don't use it unless you really have to."

Ryan sighed after hearing that, but in the end, it made sense. They were talking about the Greek god of the oceans. He had plenty of power and experience to do that, even inside a crossbow and where the limit of his actions was limited.

"Can you tell us in detail the whole battle?" Loki asked. "I want to hear more about how not only a human defeated an elder god, but how he fooled him as well."

" No," Ryan replied.

The look in Loki's eyes gave Ryan the creeps. He almost looked sexually aroused just by imagining Ryan and Poseidon fighting. Working with such a good couldn't be avoided, but Ryan would rather avoid getting closer to him. After all, Loki looked like someone who might stab in the heart and then laugh maniacally in delight.
