Chapter 621: Farewell

Chapter 621: Farewell

Ryan summoned several magic bows and bombard the creature in front of him. However, for some odd reason, the projectiles stopped a few meters away from the target.

"I can feel the enemy concentrating a lot of mana in front of himself to control the waters," Femradiel said. " It looks like your attacks aren't heavy enough to surpass that defensive barrier."

There was no barrier, but Ryan agreed with Femradiel. That creature in front of him used the water around to decrease the speed of the projectiles and thus stop them at some point. However, what was really worrying was the fact that the target didn't look even a little bit flustered or target. Meaning that he stopped Ryan's attacks with ease. That was shocking since Ryan was in his draconic form.

While that wasn't his forte, Ryan decided to go for a closed-ranged fight. He could use several tactics to catch the enemy by surprise, but before he could do that. The other enemies finally appeared. They had teleported as well, and Ryan clicked his tongue. Still, once again, he was overcome by surprise. Those individuals were pretty different from one another, but their eyes were basically the same.

"What do you think of this, Femradiel?" Ryan asked while he was turning around and checking the enemies.

"It looks like a certain family of not entirely human beings is working for Poseidon directly," Femradiel replied. "Or those guys are his children. I can feel a certain type of energy coming from them, and it feels quite like god-like."

Ryan didn't want to admit that that was the cause, but he couldn't help but agree. Dungeon masters aren't like normal people. They are beings; they reached a crazy level of strength, so it wouldn't be weird if they could pass certain traits to their kids. Even in mythology, that was something that happened. The fact that one of them easily stopped Ryan's attack was good enough evidence.

Although Ryan didn't have time to think about that, the enemies were surprisingly quiet. They were just looking at him with their nonchalant expressions as if they weren't bored or enthusiastic for that fight and gave Ryan the creeps.

"Let's go, Femradiel," Ryan said.

Ryan teleported to behind his first target, the man-like creature called Rhodos. Ryan tried to punch him from behind, but he felt something powerful holding him back. It was the waters around Despite that, Ryan overcame that and punched his foe, but his attack barely made the enemy flinch. Rhodos just turned around as if nothing had happened.

The other enemies teleported again, but only to assume a circular formation around Ryan. Aside from that, they didn't do anything. Femradiel made the spear spin and attacked Rhodos, but he just moved his hand slightly, and the weapon loses all that speed and momentum. It looked like his ability to manipulate ice was also at a high level.

"Ryan, I do not like this," Femradiel said.

"You don't say!" Ryan said and then attacked Rhodos with both his arms from above.

This time, Rhodos raised his right hand to stop Ryan, and thanks to it, he stopped. However, Ryan didn't stop there. He made several magic bows appear around the enemy and then bombarded him. This time the bolts approached Rhodos more than before, the reason being that Ryan fired at point-blank range and because he used the Spiritualist's Crossbows.

In the end, Rhodos punched Ryan's arms away when he felt his mana being drained by the attack. Obviously, the enemies were creatures that focused on fighting by using magic, so Ryan wouldn't lose a golden opportunity to drain their mana. However, that punch made Ryan question that

"I told you that it wasn't a good idea to come to the ocean right now" Femradiel said.

"I hate when people say 'I told you" Ryan said.

There was no point in insisting on what was useless, so Ryan teleported too high in the sky in order to escape the enemies' favorite field of battle. However, much to his surprise, the ten creatures followed him without hesitating for even a second.

"Well, this is unexpected" Ryan said.

Ryan charged toward Rhodos again, and this time the enemy had to use both hands to stop him. The air vibrated thanks to Ryan's attack, and Rhodo's calm expression finally disappeared. Soon after, Ryan bombarded the enemy with bolts from all angles. Still, even though they touched the enemies' skin, they didn't leave a single scratch.

Femradiel attacked the creature from behind by using the double-edged spear. Still, Rhodos stopped the attack once again, this time after creating a layer of ice with his right knee and by hitting the weapon.

Ryan began to like the fight, but he knew that he had to hurry since the others probably won't keep watching for long if Rhodos began to lose the fight. However, it looked like Ryan misjudged their actions the atmosphere around them changed for some reason, and soon after, all of the enemies pointed their hands toward Ryan.

"Ryan this isn't good," Femradiel said. "This magic is"

"What magic?" Ryan asked.

Ryan asked, but he didn't hear an answer. Femradiel suddenly grew silent, and that was weird He only understood that something was off when he noticed his status decreasing and his big body growing heavy. Ryan tried to teleport since he had no idea what the enemies were doing. However, Teleport didn't work. Ryan tried to run away by flying, but he ended up hitting an invisible barrier.

"Damn, another fucking barrier" Ryan clenched his teeth in annoyance.

Ryan tried to come up with an answer for that predicament, but in the end, the only thing he could do was to attack the casters. He grabbed his spear that was falling in the blink of an eye since Femradiel was off and then dashed toward the other nine targets, but Rhodos stopped him. This time, with a single hand since Ryan's status was decreasing at a fearsome pace.

Rhodos kicked Ryan's stomach, and he was sent flying toward the barrier. When his body hit it, he spat blood as he felt his ribs cracking. Suddenly, Ryan felt his body growing hot as if some supernatural force was warning him of something, and then he heard Femradiel moaning in pain as his mana decreased.

" My bad, Ryan," Femradiel said. "There is no other choice."

Before Ryan could understand those words, he saw his spear glowing. The enemies noticed that, and for some reason, they started to panic. Suddenly, the weapon exploded into millions of small pieces, and a massive wave of mana enveloped the area. Still, Before Ryan could get caught by it, Femradiel teleported him.
