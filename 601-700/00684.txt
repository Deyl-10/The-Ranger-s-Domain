Chapter 684: Tips

That was one of the worst things that could happen. Lucas and his allies couldn't fight since they didn't have enough numbers, but they couldn't strengthen themselves either. In the near future, the difference in strength will be so absurd that they will lose their domain in a matter of hours.

"It seems you are a bit busy facing the same problem, am I right?" Lucas asked.

"You are right, but I think I can help if they are on the offensive and outside a dungeon or domain," Ryan said. "Come to think of it, if you have the right skills, you can decimate them yourself."

Ryan explained his modus operandi in the last few days to Lucas. Use Invisibility and then leave the planet and then attack from outer space. He could also use Draconic Transformation even better. Lucas has been using the Death Knight class for longer, so he probably was strong enough to pull that off. Even without the Mana Barrier. Based on his experience, even elder gods or demons couldn't feel the mana being gathered from outside the planet, so it was a pretty good place to attack.

"You are joking, right?" Lucas asked. "How can a human being pull that off?"

"How can a human being transform into a dragon?" Ryan asked. "You should try to test new things, the elder gods are coming to Earth, and if we want to survive a battle against them, we can't use only common sense. Anyway, even if you don't have coins to buy Mana Barrier, you should be able to survive outer space for a few seconds. If you don't feel confident, I can give you a hand and show you how it is done."

"Well if you think I can do it, then I will try," Lucas said. "Talk to you later."

Although Ryan said that he could give a hand, in the end, he had to avoid that as much as possible. Even in his draconic form, he needed some time and a lot of mana to fire a projectile strong enough to decimate thousands of enemies. Since magic wasn't his forte, it was more efficient to hunt monsters using crossbows and bows, even though it takes a while longer.

"How can a human being transform into a dragon" Ryan muttered. "Hey, Femradiel. Now that I think about it, isn't it weird that human beings can become vessels of dragons and quickly show all their power?"

"How so?" Femradiel asked.

"First of all, it is weird that our body can grow like that and return to normal as if nothing had happened," Ryan said. "Aside from that, even considering the bonus in status that we gain, it is weird that we manage to show that much power so fast."

"Really? I can't see that way," Femradiel said. "Maybe human beings are so sinful that their compatibility with draconic powers is that great."

Ryan wasn't a saint, but he wouldn't say that he was sinful, so he couldn't understand how come he never had trouble using Femradiel's powers. Regardless, that maybe was a question he will find an answer to later in the game.

Regardless, even though Ryan was complaining that he will have to face new and more powerful opponents every day in his new life, now he was itching for a good fight. Or at least to find an enemy in which he could use Wolf's Greed from the safety of his domain. That being said, it didn't look like Baal would show up anytime soon. Again, for a battle-oriented demon, he sure was taking his time in building his forces. Did he really respect Ryan's power all that much? He was the only threat on their path, after all. Daniel and the others might be a threat together, but if Baal joins the battlefield It was hard to imagine them winning.

In the end, before that day could end, Ryan managed to clear another dungeon, but it looked like fate was throwing at him one of those stupid jokes. Ryan could almost hear that trying to look for classes now was a waste of time.

"This is getting old quickly," Ryan said and then sighed. "Maybe I should just attack those fuckers and then quickly retreat and not give them the chance to counter-attack. That should be possible now that Daniel and the other idiots will deal with Lilith."

In the end, Ryan felt troubled for a while, wondering about his options. Still, then he had a certain idea that seemed pretty interesting. Still, he couldn't help but wonder why he didn't think of that before.
