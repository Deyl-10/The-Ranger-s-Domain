Chapter 609: Sea Nymph

Chapter 609: Sea Nymph

Unlike the Succubus, the Mermaids weren't using illusions to look more beautiful. That was probably why Ryan saw hundreds of Triton bosses guarding their dungeon and the underwater city they had created in the area.

"That is odd why are they protecting other species that certainly don't look like warrior species?" Ryan frowned.

"They must be a species of creatures that work for Poseidon," Femradiel said. "They aren't warriors, but Poseidon considers them his own people and thus made them create a base in these parts."

"Nymph? Aren't they mermaids?" Ryan frowned.

"I can sense some active mana in their legs maybe they used some transformation technique to increase their movement underwater," Femradiel said.

Ryan watched a movie in the past where Hercules had a son with a Nymph, and that was why he knew some things about them. Though he didn't know if that knowledge was actually true. The nymphs were usually associated with fertile, growing things, such as trees or with water. They were not immortal but were extremely long-lived and were on the whole kindly disposed toward men. They were distinguished according to the sphere of nature with which they were connected.

"According to Greek mythology, many of their gods had offspring with Nymphs, but" Ryan furrowed his eyebrows. "I didn't think they were that many."

A few hundred meters ahead of them, Ryan and Femradiel could see an underwater city made of crystal. It was astonishingly beautiful since pretty much everything was so transparent. In any case, none of that actually mattered. Ryan couldn't let such a base that obviously belonged to Poseidon so close to his country. However, not only thanks to the Tritons, Ryan noticed that he had to beware of, but he found some of Hydra's bosses in the area, making sure that no enemy would approach that city.

"It looks like Poseidon values this place quite a bit," Ryan said while grinning. "Maybe I should try to hit him where it hurts."

"What Alissa said is really true you have a talent at getting on other people's nerves," Femradiel said. "In any case, you should prepare yourself if you really plan to destroy this place. "

Weirdly enough, Femradiel didn't try to stop Ryan probably because he was in his Draconic form. His weapons suffered a severe upgrade in the last few days. In any case, usually, Ryan would try to get rid of the small fries first since he would have to deal with a massive barrage of attacks, but in that situation, getting rid of the big guns would be wiser.

"Femradiel, can you track the positions of all Hydras in a fifty kilometers radius?" Ryan asked.

"Yes, but the very moment I notice them, they will probably notice me as well," Femradiel replied.

"That is fine," Ryan said. "Just focus on finding them one after the other. After that, we will kill all of them as fast as possible."

That seemed like a pretty bold strategy, but Femradiel realized that probably was the best one. After dealing with the Hydras, nothing a single creature in the area would bother Ryan once he attacks the underwater city. The perimeter that the Hydras created to keep the Nymphs said from external attacks would be used against them.

Ryan gave Femradiel the task of finding the Hydras and using Teleport to face them before they try to alert the city's inhabitants. Their first target showed a look of surprise when Ryan, in his draconic form, suddenly appeared in front of itself, and that gave Ryan a chance he had been looking for. Ryan bombarded the creature with magic copies of his Spiritualist's Crossbow. While the beast resisted for a while, in the end, it failed at charging at Ryan and at using any spell since the monster's mana had been drained completely.

"Next," Ryan said.

"Shouldn't we get rid of the body first?" Femradiel asked.

"If there isn't anyone to notice, no one will notice," Ryan replied. "If we get rid of all enemies in the area before they find anything weird, it doesn't matter if they get rid of the bodies or not."

"I guess that does make sense," Femradiel said. "I feel embarrassed knowing that you realized that and I didn't."

"What is that supposed to mean?" Ryan frowned.

Instead of replying, Femradiel used Teleport and reached the next target. This time Ryan used Absolute Appraisal and confirmed what he more or less knew that he was running out of time.

"Oh, boy" Ryan said and then sighed. "I'd better pick up the pace."

After saying that, Ryan made his bolts rain over the Hydra's face that was swimming toward him.
