Chapter 688: Isaac And Martha

Chapter 688: Isaac and Martha

It was weird that Ryan recognized them right away. They were carrying some pretty impressive dark weapons and were wearing sets of dark armor. Still, their faces were something that Ryan would never forget. His father, who had short light-brown hair that also had some hints of grey and despite his age, had a much more impressive physique than Ryan's. His mother, who had long blond hair and despite being in her fifties, looked twenty years younger and also had a gentle expression on her face alongside her green eyes

"Calm down, Ryan," Femradiel said. "No matter how you look at it, this is just a trap to fool you."

Ryan was trembling from head to toe. That surprise completely paralyzed him because even without using Absolute Appraisal, he was one hundred percent sure they were his parents. However, there was something weird with their eyes they were vacant as if they were looking at something that didn't exist in the physical realm.

In the end, Ryan's predictions weren't off the mark. He used Appraisal and confirmed that they were his parents. Their names were right although they didn't have a rank, that was just a minor detail.

The very moment they noticed Ryan's presence, the two of them flew while attacking Ryan. He barely saw the projectiles moving, but Femradiel reacted on time and teleported them to escape the attacks. Isaac's dark bow seemed the most powerful bow Ryan and Femradiel had seen so far. The arrows were so fast and powerful that they left the air vibrating when they passed a certain location. As for Martha, every time she pointed a magic staff toward Ryan, massive Fireballs and Ice Spears would fly toward him.

"What is going on? What is going on?" Ryan raised his voice. "They are supposed to be dead! Both of them!"

"I said to calm down! Dumbass!" Femradiel raised her voice as well. "Did you pick a fight with elder gods, demons, and fucking dungeon masters without expecting at least this much? Of course, they would use dirty tricks like to make you lose your cool."

Ryan didn't expect that all his fights would be clear, direct fights where both sides would do their best without using dirty tricks. Still, that was beyond what Ryan had expected. That was too low. Using his dead parents against him was the only thing Ryan couldn't forgive.

"For the time being, let's return to the interior of our domain," Femradiel said. "Even if they are powerful, they are only two human beings. Besides, they can only cause so much damage without a decent source of mana."

Ryan and Femradiel teleported to the domain's interior, and then Isaac and Martha proceeded to bombard the barrier. For moments like these, Ryan kept a massive stock of mana and upgraded the barrier daily, but at that pace, his parents will destroy the barrier in a couple of hours.

"Try to use Wolf's Greed. That should slow down a little bit. Perhaps they will run away," Femradiel said.

Ryan's mind was in turmoil that he didn't even consider. However, in the end, for some odd reason, Wolf's Greed didn't work in either of them. Not even Ryan's arrows could be as fast as his father's, so it was evident that he was stronger than him. Thanks to that, he couldn't understand what was going on.

"You will have to attack them. We need to discourage them from attacking this intensely," Femradiel said.

" What?" Ryan asked.

While Ryan could understand the logic behind Femradiel's words, since their attacks were as powerful as meteors, his heart didn't accept that. Attacking his parents? There is no way he would do that.

"I can't attack them" Ryan said. "I won't attack them."

"No matter what you say, they clearly aren't that fragile," Femradiel said. "Besides, what are the chances that they won't try to block or dodge the attacks? We need to slow them down at the very least!"

"I won't attack them" Ryan declared.

Ryan's attitude puzzled Femradiel. She knew from the very beginning that family was a difficult topic for Ryan. Still, she didn't imagine something like that would happen. Ryan lost all his will to fight, and the idea of attacking his parents seemed like madness. Someone found Ryan's switch and then decided to use it against him in the nastiest way. That surprised Ryan in some aspects, but not in the others. After all, he had done plenty of nasty stuff to his enemies.

In the end, not even Femradiel could attack those two freely. So, she summoned some Ice Walls to block their attacks, but in the end, she could only do so much with that body.

"If you can't do anything else, then at least give me your mana," Femradiel said.

Ryan hesitated since Femradiel was too keen on attacking his parents. Still, in the end, she wasn't crazy enough to kill them. Ryan used Support Mana Arrow and recovered Femradiel's mana at a fearsome speed. Thanks to that, she managed to obtain enough power to block those two attacks. Still, even Ryan's mana had a limit, but as for those two, it looked like they wouldn't run out of gas anytime soon.

"Did you forget, Ryan?" Femradiel asked. "Your parents are dead; you can tell by the look in their eyes that they weren't revived. Someone transformed them into zombies, but you can bet their spirits are somewhere in there. You probably don't know, but the spirit of a zombie will never find peace unless they are put down. If you want to help your parents, right now, you need to defeat them and make sure that no one will be able to torment them like this"
