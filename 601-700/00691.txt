Chapter 691: Warmaster

Chapter 691: Warmaster

Ryan had no idea how long it would take to find Thanatos or if he will even return to his domain, but in the end, he had to make some preparations. If he were to fail, Femradiel would have to manage the domain. Furball will eventually reach a power level where even big bosses will have a hard time against him, but he will need some more time to reach that level.

Since the same trick won't work twice against the demons, Ryan prepared something else for them aside from the battle machines. He was one hundred percent sure that Baal will make his move once he realizes that Ryan left his domain, after all.

As soon as the preparations were ready, Ryan and Femradiel left while invisible. That journey might take weeks since Thanatos wasn't stupid enough to use Specters all over the world as monsters for his arm. While they were troublesome, they were far from being the perfect soldiers for his army.

"Shouldn't we at least ask Isis or Athena the locations of the dungeons under his control in order to choose the best to attack?" Femradiel asked.

"If we do that, he will learn that some of the elder gods are cooperating with us," Ryan replied. "That is too risky. Besides, I know that fighting him directly isn't a wise idea. So, I will piss him off before anything and then try to recover the fragments of my parents' souls one after the other."

First of all, Ryan began to look for high concentrations of monsters. Thanatos probably had a massive army at this point in time, or at the very least, he probably already can manifest himself on Earth. Ryan's ultimate goal was to lure him out to Earth. If that takes time, so be it. Ryan will slowly destroy all the monsters under his command.

While it wasn't a dungeon where Femradiel didn't find any traces of Thanatos' mana, Ryan still decided to clear a certain tier-three dungeon in Canada. It was the last one that Alissa told him before she disappeared to China. He did that because he needed to grow in strength, coin, and items.

"What an unexpected class," Ryan frowned. "It is pretty useful for a tier-three class."

If Ryan could have enough time to level it up Still, he couldn't take his time. While Ryan found some dungeons he hadn't cleared before, he ignored them all in South America since they weren't tier-three dungeons. After a while, when they were crossing the Mediterranean, Femradiel warned him. In the end, Ryan was correct many Greek gods would set their dungeons in that region of the world since it was near to Greece.

"I feel many traces of powerful presences, while they aren't nearby, it looks like many elder gods stepped on Earth for some reason," Femradiel said. "In that direction I can feel several presences that are similar to your parents eight of them."

That was fast. Ryan and Femradiel barely had approached the Mediterranean in any case, Ryan knew that he would find Spain in that direction. It was pretty far away from Greece

"Any powerful presence aside from those that belong to my parents?" Ryan asked.

"Yes I can't say who's that presence belongs to, but there is an intense presence that resembles Thanatos quite a lot," Femradiel said.

"A similar presence" Ryan rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "If I remember well, Thanatos has a twin brother. Hypnos, Greek god that was the personification of sleep."

Ryan felt an urge to attack the dungeon, but considering that Thanatos' split his parents' spirits, all the remaining fragments weren't there. So, Ryan didn't have any reason to take so many risks right at that moment.

Ryan decided to check other parts of Europe, but he didn't find any dungeon that Femradiel sensed Thanatos' presence. Clearing dungeons at that moment seemed like a bad idea since it would reveal his presence to his enemies, so Ryan ignored even the tier three dungeons that he found. It looked like they will have to investigate the Western side of Russia or the Middle Orient, but then suddenly

"Wait" Femradiel said and then looked in a certain direction and frowned.

"What?" Ryan asked.

"I felt a strange presence in that direction, only a for a moment, though," Femradiel said. "It resembled Thanatos, but it is weird, but it was a bit different as well."

Ryan and Femradiel were flying above the Black Sea. Then he opened the map to see what was in that direction the first country he would find in Romania.
