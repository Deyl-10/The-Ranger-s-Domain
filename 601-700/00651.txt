Chapter 651: Hard To Describe

Chapter 651: Hard to describe

When Ryan was about to look for another dungeon that broke, Isis contacted him. That had been a lot sooner than he had imagined. But soon, he understood why Isis contacted him like that.

"It looks like you have been busy dealing with the forced dungeon breaks," Isis said. "Do you know that Poseidon was the one who planned that?"

"Yes," Ryan replied.

"Good, that will save some time," Isis said. "Poseidon is planning to make the other Greek gods return as fast as possible, but he understood that staying on the defensive won't help them all that much, so he devised another strategy to achieve that goal. He is defending his allies by making their dungeons break, but he is also attacking his enemies."

"How exactly is he attacking his enemies?" Ryan asked. "You said that he wouldn't leave the ocean any time soon."

"He found a way to attack without leaving the oceans," Isis replied. "It is hard to describe what he did since I didn't see it. All that I know is that one of my allies' camps was decimated in a single moment. You need to warn your friends and make them watch the skies. I don't know how, but Poseidon destroyed a ten kilometers large survivors camp attacking from above."

Ryan frowned when he heard that it seemed weird that the god of the seas would attack from the sky, and no one would live to tell what happened. Regardless, everyone knew that Poseidon was resourceful enough to pull a crazy stunt like that.

"Don't you have any spy that is keeping an eye on Poseidon's castle?" Ryan asked.

"I have, but even though I can communicate with them, they didn't notice anything out of the ordinary there," Isis said. "That is why I decided to warn you. Most likely, he will attack those that participated in the last attack. My allies had a domain, but not even their barrier resisted. So, your own domain might become a target. That is all I came to say. I will keep investigating that place."

After that, Isis canceled Telepathy, and Ryan couldn't help but wonder what had happened. How Poseidon, the god of the seas, managed to destroy a domain and everyone inside it with an attack from the sky? Ryan pondered about that while he headed toward his domain.

After confirming that things were fine there, Ryan told Gustavo and the others what Isis told him. At the same time, he checked things in Daniel's domain. He had no other choice since Arthur and Zoe were there. That being said, Daniel is quite powerful, so he probably will be able to prevent the destruction of his domain. He had a lot of human allies, and they were better to gather energy for the domain.

"It is a bit too soon for that, but at this point in time, I will have to speed up things a little bit," Ryan rubbed his chin thoughtfully.

Ryan used Earth Transformation and Earth Creation to make some iron towers around his domain. Above those, he put some platforms that would be used to garrison skeleton archers. While those monsters still were at a low level, their long-ranged attacks would give them the chance to attack most flying enemies even before they got too close. Ryan also created some ballistae. Since the skeletons' mana would be used to charge them and several skeletons would use them, their firing speed would be pretty decent. It was a pity that Ryan couldn't teach them skills, but he will make do with the things he has.

After creating dozens of those towers, Ryan didn't feel satisfied. So, he spent several hours hunting specters and turning them into Spiritualist's Crossbows. Those weapons only become truly useful once they are upgraded ten or so times. Still, Ryan didn't have time to create, much less upgrade so many weapons for thousands of skeletons.

Since he could only create so many weapons using specters without causing a dungeon break, Ryan decided to use the other monsters that were spawning inside his domain. With the Giant Skulls, Ryan could forge weapons that could cause direct damage to a foe's mana. Ryan armed five hundred skeletons with crossbows in a single day that could decrease and steal a foe's mana.

"I don't feel satisfied yet, but I can only stay here for so long," Ryan muttered. "Poseidon probably used a long-ranged magic attack using some kind of tool. If my skeletons attack the tool's mana pool, the attack won't destroy my domain probably. At the very least, by using them, I will gain some time to use Teleport and return."

Ryan would need to keep an eye on his domain at all times, but that was only natural. The tutorial was over now that some dungeon masters are finally able to show their true power on Earth. After making a mental note to arm at least two hundred of his skeletons every day to strengthen the defenses of his domain, Ryan departed to check which dungeons broke while he was working on his domain.

While Ryan was checking for those, he found some low-level dungeons and decided to clear those just to check one thing. After cleaning two in a matter of minutes, he confirmed his suspicion.

Your dexterity has increased by one point.

Congratulations! The skill Elven Mastery has leveled up.

Elven Mastery leveled up a single time after Ryan cleared ten dungeons. Just like Wolf's Greed, that leveled up after he used the same skill for ten seconds. Regardless, that wasn't really the question what really mattered was that he could level up the skill and increase his dexterity by clearing dungeons that he already cleared. That would help Ryan quite a bit in the long run
