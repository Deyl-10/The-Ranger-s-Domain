Chapter 641: Second Round

Chapter 641: Second round

While it took a while, Ryan managed to decrease the pressure that his allies were having to endure. Ryan felt that he wasted some time, time that he could have used to increase his dexterity. Still, thanks to that, he had time to help his friends, focus his head on thinking, and notice that he would spend much more time and tranquility to use Wolf's Greed when his allies were defeating Poseidon's sons. However, Ryan could have the chance to put that tactic to use Rhodos decided to act.

Rhodos stepped back from the battlefield a few hundred meters. Then, in the blink of an eye, dozens of giant Ice Spears appeared around him were fired toward Gustavo and the others. Ryan pointed his magic bows to them and managed to stop the projectiles. Even underwater, he could do that, but for how long?

Ryan's mana was being used at an insane speed, and the best he could do was prevent his allies from being attacked by the projectiles. He had prepared thousands of mana potions from a battle of attrition, but in the end, it would only last for so long. That being said, the fact that Rhodos wasn't attacking them alleviated the situation for Gustavo and the others exponentially.

"Can I leave these guys to you?" Ryan asked.

"Just be quick about it," Gustavo replied. "Just don't forget what is our goal here."

Ryan nodded. While he couldn't understand how come Gustavo wanted him to defeat an enemy, he failed at defeating before, even with his draconic powers. That was another matter.

Ryan used Teleport and then appeared right in front of Rhodos, and he landed his right Elbow on his enemies' faces. Before the enemy could reach, he kicked his stomach. Ryan planned to broke his chin with another punch, but then the waters moved, and he was immobilized. Rhodos obtained some time to breathe, but not for long. Fifteen magic bows appeared around him and bombarded him. He didn't have time to control the water around and stop the projectiles, so he noticed his endurance, intelligence, and speed decreases. Ryan had used Vital Hunter, the effects of his Immobilizing Crossbow and Inquisitor's Crossbow.

Rhodos teleported away to escape the barrage of attacks, and thanks to that, his control over Ryan's body decreased. Ryan prepared a punch, and then he used Teleport. Rhodos imagined what Ryan was planning, but he didn't expect that Ryan would teleport to a little below him and then punch his balls.

"Oh? It looks live you do have balls," Ryan smirked. "You are more human than you look, thanks for letting me realize that."

While Rhodos was recovering from the attack, Ryan bombarded him with his magic bows. While his most troublesome weapon was probably his control over the water, Ryan couldn't afford to only decrease his intelligence.

Rhodos couldn't understand how he was having a hard time facing Ryan in his human form when he barely had the chance to do anything in his draconic form. Trying to understand what was going on, Rhodos fired those massive Ice Spears again. Still, Ryan teleported and escaped the attack, reappearing right behind him. Ryan swung his right fist, but Rhodos turned around and grabbed his arm.

"Are you sure of this?" Ryan asked and then also grabbed Rhodos' arm.

Ryan's arms blocked Rhodos' vision, and he didn't notice when Ryan summoned his spear and used Telekinesis to split in half. In the end, Rhodos dodged the attack by kicking Ryan and thus freeing himself, but that came with a price: Ryan bombarded his back with his magic crossbows.

Receiving damage from a surprise attack causes much more damage than when one knows that the attack is coming. So, the shock paralyzed Rhodos. Suddenly, a massive arrow fell from the sky, engulfed in electricity, and hit him. Several others followed it, pushing him too deep into the ocean. Despite the pain and the shock, he noticed when Ryan used Telekinesis and Spatial Manipulation to pour several potions on his back. Potions that increased his strength, speed and recovered his mana.

"Crap he noticed it," Ryan clicked his tongue in annoyance since he had made another mistake.

While that was a small mistake, Ryan had planned to stop doing even those. Thanks to a small mistake, now his enemy wasn't confused anymore. Regardless, before Rhodos could return, Ryan moved toward the castle's center as fast as possible. He could have teleported. Still, he wanted to make Rhodos feel the despair of seeing him moving toward Poseidon's dungeon.

Rhodos teleported and blocked his path, but in the end, he chose the wrong place to appear he appeared between Ryan and the castle. Those three were connected by a diagonal line, so if Ryan were to attack, Rhodos would dodge. The castle would be damaged. Rhodos noticed that too late Ryan bombarded him like before with his bolts that decreased his status. Rhodos dodged them, and several places in the castle were destroyed. Rhodos looked at the damaged parts and then at Ryan, only to see him smirking while he was using the Hydra's Bow with Telekinesis.

Ryan touched the weapon and activated Power Shot, and activated Charge Traps on the gigantic arrow dozens of them. Rhodos gulped when he felt so much energy being drained by the projectile. If something that big were to hit the castle while so much mana is in it

"It is time to choose," Ryan said while he was smirking, but his eyes were almost lifeless and cold. "Take the attack head on, or let it fall. Naturally, you can always try to use water and stop it, but I wonder if you can prevent the energy from spreading and destroying everything around."
