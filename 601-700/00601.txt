Chapter 601: Team work

It was only obvious due to its size, but the crystal was much sturdier than the layer, and these scales were made of crystal around the monster's body. Ryan's ice and fire Arrow didn't leave a single scratch after heating and cooling its surface. He tried the opposite order, but nothing changed.

Before Ryan could think of some plan to deal with that weapon, the dungeon master dashed toward him, already swinging his sword downward. Ryan dodged by using Flash, but even before the monster could finish the swing, it already changed the direction of the attack and moved toward Ryan. That happened so fast that Ryan only managed to escape since he used Evading Shot since that skill was engraved in his being, and he used it countless times when he was about to be attacked by something. Still, despite that, the gust of wind caused by the sword's swing made Ryan's skin being pierced in several parts. His torso escaped thanks to his armor, but his face and arms started to bleed.

"It looks like two big swings are his limits," Ryan said while he used Heal to stop the bleeding. "At least when it comes to continuous attack."

"I am not much of a sword fighter, but I can see that his movements are just fast but not skilled," Femradiel said.

That was only natural since the mind behind the monster was a mad scientist-like being who creates chimeras. In any case, having a powerful weapon and a powerful body sometimes was more than enough in most situations.

After recovering from the first attack, the dungeon master prepared the next one, but this time the creature just dashed toward Ryan without swinging the sword. Ryan moved to the side to dodge the massive body, only to find the weapon being swung toward him the monster waited for the last moment to attack. Ryan could escape by using Teleport, but he had a bad feeling about that in the end, Ryan teleported away from the monster. Still, the creature also repeated Ryan's action, so in the end, nothing changed.

In the end, Ryan was hit by the sword and was completely shattered into pieces but the dungeon master frowned when he saw that Ryan had become an ice mirror.

"So, he can use Teleport as well," Ryan said while watching the dungeon master from several hundred meters above the creature. "What a pain"

"Can I join the fight? If we divide his attention, our chances will improve considerably," Femradiel said.

"What are you talking about?" Ryan asked. "You are already fighting and doing something even more important: using mana potions for me."

"You know what I am talking about" Femradiel said and then sighed. "We will waste too much time in here if things keep going like this, unless you use Draconic Transformation, the chances of you dying in a single strike is pretty high. A single mistake and it is game over."

"That only makes things more interesting, right?" Ryan shrugged. "Besides, why do you think that he had the advantage in a longer fight?"

Femradiel considered Ryan's words now that she thought about it, the dungeon master only assumed control over that body when they found it. The creature certainly didn't want to fight. It even asked for them to leave most likely, that body wasn't ready for real fights yet. That was why the creature changed its strategies so many times, even though Ryan only landed a single critical hit.

"Well, if you want to help even more and all that much, I suppose you can," Ryan said.

In the end, Femradiel didn't even try to explain to Ryan what she intended to do. She used Teleport and then appeared right in the back of the monsters and then attached herself to the monster's body as if she were a cicada.

"So much for teamwork," Ryan frowned.

After a few moments, the boss noticed Femradiel's presence when she began to emit a cold aura through her body. It didn't take long for a thin layer of ice began to spread behind the monster's body. The dungeon master tried to shake her away, but the creature only looked silly, trying to scratch its back and moving from one side to the other. Hoping that the weight and pressure of his movements would make her fall.

"I see" Ryan rubbed his chin thoughtfully.

Ryan activated Perfect Aim and Deadly Aim. At the same time, he selected a frozen area several meters below the point where Femradiel was. Without a hint of hesitation, he fired several fire arrows with his Hydra's Bow. The dungeon master was too busy, thanks to Femradiel, so he didn't notice the projectiles coming. In the end, the arrows landed and caused massive explosions that finally made the massive body tremble for real for the first time in that fight. At the same time, a considerable part of the crystal layer protecting the monster's body cracked and fell Ryan and Femradiel didn't lose that opportunity and attacked while the beast was in shock. Massive fire arrows and Ice Meteors fell on the monster's back, and then the creature finally began to bleed that was some progress.

"The heck is that?" Ryan frowned.

The monster's blood was blue. It was the exact same thing Ryan saw leaving Seth's body when he wounded him. The blood was actually mana in its liquid form was that a coincidence? While Ryan was busy thinking about why the monster's blood was blue, Femradiel created a container of ice and then put the liquid inside of it. That certainly required some study, or Femradiel just wanted to make Ryan use that since she teleported the object toward him.

"My work how dare you damage my masterpiece?" The dungeon master asked.

"It looks like this guy see himself like some sort of artist," Ryan frowned and then stored the container in his spatial dimension. "What a joke."
