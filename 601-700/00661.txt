Chapter 661: Not Bad

Chapter 661: Not bad

Poseidon stopped that attack, and while he was thinking of a way to kill Ryan once and for all, Ryan did the same thing Ice Breath did previously, but without relying on Ice Breath. Instead, he froze the air around Poseidon, and with all his might, he tried to envelop him in a thin but powerful layer of ice. Just by moving his muscles, Poseidon managed to crack it, but Ryan used Mana Manipulation and strengthened the ice prison.

Before Poseidon could muster a little more strength to free himself, a massive storm of arrows began to fall over him. He didn't have time to react since he didn't see Ryan preparing another attack. In fact, Ryan didn't prepare for another attack. Instead, he used all his might to keep Poseidon locked in a single place. Poseidon tried to defend himself by creating a thick layer of water above him. Still, the rain over arrows was more intense than the water he could create without relying on his strength. As if that wasn't enough, the arrows easily pierced the water and made their way to his body. Poseidon finally snapped when he saw his endurance decreasing.

"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!" Poseidon shouted.

With his shout, Poseidon dissipated all the ice Ryan had created to immobilize him. Thanks to that, Poseidon confirmed that the arrows didn't come from Ryan's attacks. Instead, it came from weird creatures that were flying a few kilometers above them they were Ryan's Red Falcons and, on their backs, their dozens of Skeleton Archers.

Poseidon tried to destroy the projectiles with Magic Disrupt, but he failed since those projectiles hadn't been fired by Magic Bows. Poseidon swung his spear and easily deflected hundreds of bolts and arrows, but in the end, he barely could stop half of the attacks. Hundreds of Red Falcons flying above them, and each falcon had dozens of skeleton archers on their backs.

Poseidon pointed his spear at them, but then he was forced to stop when he heard the sound of something big flying toward him. Ryan had just fired the Gigantic Hydra's bow. So, naturally, he wouldn't let him do whatever he wanted.

Poseidon swung his trident and then destroyed the massive arrow. Then he immediately teleported to where the Red Falcons were. Firing dozens of Ice Spears, he killed the monsters. Only a few skeletons managed to survive, but those wouldn't be able to do much while they fall.

Another massive wave of bolts flew toward Poseidon, and he stopped them by creating a thick Ice Wall in front of him. He knew such a tactic wouldn't stop Ryan for long, but Poseidon had confidence that he would kill all the flying monsters before that could happen. However, Poseidon stopped after a while when he noticed that something was off Ryan's bolts weren't damaging the Ice Wall as much as they should.

Poseidon stopped attacking, and that gave the Red Falcons the chance to fly away from him. Meanwhile, Ryan was smirking while firing with his Magic Bows and was using some potions.

"Go on, attack them," Ryan said.

Poseidon didn't like that situation; his instincts were telling him that Ryan was planning something troublesome. Still, his instincts were also telling him that he couldn't approach carelessly. Attacking without knowing what was about to happen didn't seem like a good idea either, so Poseidon began to spin his trident. Then, the Atlantic Ocean began to approach. Ryan couldn't help but click his tongue at Poseidon's caution and stupid control over water. Still, in the end, he decided to make a bet.

Ryan kept firing with the magic copies of his Aquatic Crossbow. Still, he also created another arrow with pure wind magic. Poseidon couldn't help but frown when the spear became an electric spear, and then its size surpassed Ryan's in a matter of seconds Ryan shouldn't have such control over magic. His intelligence wasn't that high. At that moment, Poseidon used Appraisal on his magic bows and then saw what they could do they increased the user's intelligence with each shot. Adding that with all the INT potions he had used, Ryan's control over magic reached almost the same level as Poseidon.

"Dirt worm" Poseidon clenched his teeth and then said.

"Oh, you can talk!" Ryan smirked. "Not bad for a fishman."

Poseidon dashed toward Ryan since dodging the attack was impossible. He could only prevent its power even more. After all, the more power a magic projectile has, the faster it can be.

Poseidon flew toward Ryan from one direction, trying to gain momentum and resist the power of the attack if he were to be hit. From another, Ryan could see a massive part of the Atlantic Ocean approaching. In the end, Ryan couldn't move away from that spot. While he obtained a high control over magic for a few moments, he was using all his mind to not let the stupid amount of energy not to disperse.

At the last minute, Poseidon increased his speed and pointed his trident at Ryan's arrow. When that happened, Ryan fired it. He barely had time to see it, but he saw the very moment Poseidon threw his trident against the arrow, and the projectile lost considerable power. That happened once again when Poseidon pointed both of his hands toward the arrow he used Magic Disrupt, but he didn't have time to cancel the whole attack.

The arrow exploded, and then both Ryan and Poseidon were engulfed by a massive sphere of energy. Ryan's own attack barely damaged him, if compared to the amount of power he used. Despite that, he still was sent flying downward at a tremendous speed that made him lose consciousness.
