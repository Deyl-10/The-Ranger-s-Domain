"Oh, shit you have got to be kidding me," Ryan bit his lips in exasperation.

Dullahan wasn't quite like Ryan had imagined, at least the ordinary ones. As for the bosses, they were essentially armored and headless monsters. Their armor and massive sword had a single color: purple. They also had mounts, some purple knights that apparently were another type of monster summoned by them. Regardless, they were obviously tougher than the Fire Harpies.

"I assumed this one would be easy since they couldn't fly, but" Ryan said and then sighed. "I was so dead wrong."

While feeling a headache, Ryan began to prepare for the attack. He still had several hours before the time came, so maybe he could make some modifications to his plans. Ryan recalled in the middle of his preparations that he forgot to make a weapon out of the Fire Harpies; still, they probably wouldn't create a new type of crossbow since those monsters were just regular fire monsters. Still, the thing was different with the Dullahan. It has been quite a while since Ryan saw a monster capable of using dark-related attacks. None of them were melee fighters, so his expectations were quite high for them.

Although Ryan didn't work physically all that much during his preparations, he was covered in sweat when midnight approached. The tension and his thoughts about failure worried him quite a bit. Still, in the end, he was quite confident in his battle plan.

Unlike the Fire Harpies, the Dullahan monsters were conglomerated in a single place. They were spread around the whole city since they were big and needed a decent amount of room to show their abilities. Although that wasn't a good idea, Ryan decided to fight near the ocean since apparently, he wouldn't have any place to run. That would make the monsters feel even more eager to attack.

When Ryan decided to attack, the earth suddenly trembled, and somewhere in the East side of that region, the sky suddenly began to glow that had been one heck of an explosion. When Ryan used Clairvoyance to check, he only found a sea of flames, and amidst it, thousands of monster bodies burning. Despite that, he didn't find the caster of the attack.

"It looks like another target was nearby" Ryan furrowed his eyebrows. "Still, to think that Isis would have someone capable of using such a massive attack"

It was only natural that Ryan wouldn't know everything about Isis. Still, it was weird that she didn't use such a card when her base was being attacked possibly, the boss of the attack worked for Isis's collaborator.

" Onto business," Ryan muttered when he saw the Dullahan army moving toward that region.

Ryan's skeleton army began to march, but before they could reach the enemy army, he attacked them using one of his newest skill: Doom Spear. While the spell wasn't that powerful, hundreds of monsters got hit when the magic spear exploded. The creatures trembled, and their armor began to crack as expected, that was Shadow Armor already active. Regardless, Ryan barely caused any damage. Less than ten percent of their health had decreased. Despite that, the monsters looked toward the direction the attack came from, only to find an army of skeletons moving toward them.

The Dullahan army began to run toward the skeletons. Still, before they could reach them, they suddenly were attacked by thousands of mana bullets. Ryan had hidden hundreds of combat machines below some piles of rubble. The Dullahan army tried to protect themselves, but hundreds of them quickly died.

The monsters fired their Shadow Spears without any other choice, but that only slowed down their firing speed for a short while. That had been more than enough for the Dullahan army to approach and attack the pile of rubble. However, they were attacked by another group of combat machines hidden behind the pile of debris.

Meanwhile, Ryan bombarded the Dullahan army from above with twelve copies of his Holy Crossbow + 10. Ryan made sure to attack the monster's nape just like he did with the Fire Harpies. Thanks to that, many of them fell without alerting the others. However, just like before, that only lasted for so long.

In weird but precise synchrony, thousands of Dullahan turned and looked toward Ryan. They pointed their swords toward him in the same manner, and the Shadow Spears flew toward him. Ryan teleported to high in the sky to dodge the attacks and continue on his own. However, the monsters didn't give up after a single time.

"What dumbasses" Ryan said as he started to fly in circles. "Are they blind? How can they focus on me when my machines are doing much more damage?"

Congratulations! The skill Rage has leveled up.

Soon, Ryan came to know why they were acting like that the monsters knew that they could work for so long. After a few thousand Dullahan died, the battle machines proceeded to recharge a few monsters and used that chance to destroy them.

Before Ryan could move to the next phase of his plan, he saw the Dullahan moving in a weird manner. They divided themselves into pairs, and then one of them jumped and stood still at the non-cutting side of the weapons After that, they swung those and were tossed toward Ryan.
