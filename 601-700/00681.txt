Chapter 681: Mad Archer

Ryan couldn't help but blink several times after using Appraisal on the ring it was a relic that could control time, and while it had a stupid cost and some requirements to be used, it was a pretty impressive magic item.

"Do you accept it in exchange for the domain?" Loki asked, and he didn't sound very amused, probably because he didn't succeed in fooling Ryan.

"Sure, why not?" Ryan said.

"It is a pretty impressive ring, with the mana necessary to use it, I could make a new Tyrant's body," Femradiel said.

"Keep working on that task, and I will make the necessary arrangements to use the ring," Ryan said. "Anyway, which direction are the nearest tier-three dungeons?"

Ryan had plenty of weapons and skills on his arsenal, but lately, he was having a hard time finding the ones who would be most useful against elder gods, guardians, and the fallen. So, obtaining a new class was something that he couldn't forget since they could help him with that. While some tier three classes that he obtained recently were helping him progress faster, like the Sentence skill from the Death Knight class, they weren't that definitive in a fight.

"I guess this will do," Ryan nodded to himself.

It has been a while since that happened. Still, Ryan found several dungeons that only granted classes that he already had which was really unnerving. Still, after a while, he finally obtained a class that would help him with his current fighting style. Although he didn't want to admit it, it was a class with a pretty fitting name for Ryan.

"This class fits you pretty well, don't you think?" Femradiel asked while smirking.

"Shut up," Ryan said.

In the end, Femradiel had to say that Regardless, after clearing all the tier three dungeons in the area, Ryan decided to return to his domain. While that job was completed faster than he had imagined considering that he had to fight the third strongest human, still he was exhausted.

When Ryan and Femradiel returned to the domain, Ryan couldn't help but sigh. He wanted some moments of peace, but it looked like that wouldn't be possible. His summoned monsters managed to keep the monsters that were spawning inside those ten dungeons in check, but their levels were increasing too fast. Even though the dungeons appeared less than three months ago, their levels already were above five hundred.

"Leave this to me," Femradiel said.

Femradiel left, and then while flying, she froze all the monsters that were leaving the dungeons. She did that almost instantly and thus made the fights for the summoned monsters much easier. Thanks to that, Ryan had some time to take a nap, but when he suddenly woke up feeling slightly comfortable for some reason. When he opened his eyes, he saw Femradiel looking at him closely. That made him feel weird

"If our positions were reversed, would you feel creeped out?" Ryan asked.

"Tough question," Femradiel smiled. "People unrelated would feel creeped out If our positions were reversed or not, but our level of friendship is above that, right?"

"I wouldn't know" Ryan replied and then sighed.

It looked like Ryan would have to go to outer space to have some really moments of peace, but he had rested enough for the time being. While Femradiel was hunting the monsters, Ryan restocked his potions and then decided to focus on charging Chronos' ring. However, after a while, Ryan stopped when he noticed Femradiel staring at the horizon toward the Southside of the country.

"What is wrong?" Ryan asked.

"A certain dungeon just broke South of here," Femradiel said. "I can feel a lot of dark energy and corruption coming from there."

Ryan checked that direction and then recalled what it was in that direction it was Baal's dungeon. He couldn't help but click his tongue in annoyance. Ryan focused too much on Poseidon lately, and now he spent one-week fighting and defeating Alfur.

After using Clairvoyance to check things in that direction, Ryan saw it a massive army of demons taking shape. While Ryan couldn't sense or see Baal, it didn't change the fact that Ryan will have to deal with some troublesome neighbors.
