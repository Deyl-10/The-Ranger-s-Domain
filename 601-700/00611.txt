Chapter 611: Focus On The Mission

Chapter 611: Focus on the mission

While Ryan achieved his goal more or less, he left the area feeling like he had wasted his time. While the Druid class was useful, at the moment, he was more worried about how to use his time meaningfully to slow down Poseidon.

"I have wanted to ask this for a while" Femradiel said. "When are you planning to use the coins that you have?"

"When I find something interesting to buy in the dungeon shop," Ryan replied.

Ryan didn't forget the coins he earned after defeating three dungeon masters. While skills like Vampirism and Stamina Vampirism certainly will help him a lot, Ryan didn't feel the need to buy them for the time being. However, considering how fearsome they will become after reaching a certain level, he was having a hard time keeping that kind of thought. Unless he finds an exciting tome to buy in the next few days, he probably will spend those coins on one of those options.

In any case, while he left the area to look for another dungeon to clear and Hydras to kill, Ryan found a group of Hydras heading toward the crystal city's direction. Naturally, he got on their way, but Ryan was caught off guard when he failed at stopping the charge of six ordinary Hydras even though he had twelve magic bows.

The monsters got close enough to try to bite Ryan, but he escaped by using Evading Shot. After that, they suffered too much damage to have that chance again.

"Oh, right mt power decreased since I deactivated Draconic Transformation," Ryan shook his head after a long sigh. "That was why I calculated wrong."

"While fighting with the weapons you have and without worrying about how mana you use is good, maybe you should think of a good way to use all the extra mana and increase how much damage you can cause per second," Femradiel said. "Using the mana to train some skills is fine as well."

Ryan had just thought about that. While in his Draconic form, several copies of his Spiritualist's Crossbow will be enough to stop a Hydra boss, but not in his human form. Ryan will have to find another way to achieve that.

Since the Hydra's dungeon is about to reach the max level and Poseidon will probably appear in less than a month, Ryan assumed that he would find many traces of places like the crystal city. Still, much to his surprise, he didn't.

"I suppose even Poseidon wouldn't have many chances to build that type of underwater city" Ryan rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "While that dungeon was near Cuba, it didn't have many neighboring dungeons it was the perfect place to build a base for non-warrior species."

"Should I focus on searching for places like that?" Femradiel asked.

"Nah, I don't need to deal with any more situations where I have to think if I should kill or not the monsters in the area," Ryan replied. "While letting Poseidon build these types of places kind of annoys me, we will gain a lot more by decreasing his armies."

Since that was truly their goal, Ryan and Femradiel skipped along the way several tiers, two dungeons since they were spawning monsters that were being hunted by Hydras. Still, since they were quite far from the Hydra's dungeon, their numbers were too low.

"Should we really skip the tier two dungeons?" Femradiel asked.

"Focus on the mission, Femradiel," Ryan said. "We will lose too much time if we stop in every single dungeon."

Although he said that, Ryan was telling himself whenever possible to focus on the mission as well. Despite the fact that he was thirsty for new classes. Around the time Ryan was passing the nearby Dominican Republic, he and Femradiel finally found another tier three dungeon that apparently belonged to Poseidon, in a sense. They found several Hydra's guarding the place. While they weren't bosses, their numbers were surprisingly high

"What are they doing here?" Ryan frowned.

Ryan soon got his answer. A Megalodon left the dungeon only to be bitten all over its body by the Hydras it looked like they wanted more protein in their diet. The Megalodons were big enough to provide nutrients for dozens of Hydras.

"Is it a coincidence that we found another tier-three dungeon near a country on this side of the ocean?" Ryan asked.

"It is hard to say," Femradiel replied. "If there were another underwater city nearby, I would say yes, but I can't see any strategic point in guarding this dungeon with so many monsters. They certainly can't clear the dungeon, and with those numbers, they certainly can't suppress all the monsters that will come out during a dungeon break."

"Yet, here they are, and we didn't see an army of Megalodons in the last few days," Ryan said.

From Ryan's perspective, it seemed like a waste to allocate so many monsters in a single area when each one of them was obviously stronger than a Megalodon. Then again, Poseidon wasn't controlling them directly or didn't give them the order to stay in that area. In any case, Ryan decided to act since he couldn't wait to understand the actions of monsters or beings that lived for thousands of years.

Since Ryan wanted to potentialize his attack pattern with the extra mana that he had, he decided to summon six Spiritualist's Crossbows and six Titanium Storm Bows. When the monsters felt his presence, Ryan bombarded them with his projectiles, and this time he completely put the creatures at bay, even in his human form. The monster's died without barely having the chance to move.

"The efficacy of the Titanium Storm Bow increased" Ryan rubbed his chin thoughtfully.

"Your piercing power increased, so it is only natural that their effects will be more powerful," Femradiel said.

Ryan nodded after hearing that since it made sense there was no point in having a weapon that could stun or petrify an enemy if the said weapon can't pierce a monster's hide.
