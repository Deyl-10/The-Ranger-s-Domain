Chapter 951: Chaotic Warrior

Chapter 951: Chaotic Warrior

When Ryan used Void World on Beelzebub as well, he finally had some time to check things inside, and he frowned when he saw Femradiel using ice magic to stop the demons from attacking her. While they weren't covered in ice, just a thin layer around their bodies was enough to grant her the power to do so. That was quite shocking since Ryan didn't prevent them from using their deadly sins.

The fight stopped for a while when Beelzebub appeared in the Void World, but soon they resumed their actions and began to charge toward Femradiel like mad dogs.

"It is time to create the Checkpoint, Ryan," Isis said via Telepathy. "Your plan succeeded, but we can't say that it is perfect. With that in mind, we need to use every single second to strengthen our troops."

"All right" Ryan said and then sighed.

Once Ryan created the Checkpoint, the holy knights began to appear and didn't waste time and went to purify the region. Before that could even happen, Ryan teleported to the dungeon right in the middle of the enemy formation. After killing a few bosses, he obtained another class.

Congratulations! You have cleared the dungeon and obtained its treasure! As a reward for your achievement, you can obtain one of the three following classes: Chaotic Warrior, Sentinel, and Arcanist.

"Definetely not the best, but whatever," Ryan shrugged.

Soon after that, Ryan returned to Egypt, and he saw Daniel, Yahiko, and Natasha organizing the rest of the groups. In theory, now, the human race only had three more enemies, and those three were out of the planet. So, the alliance could use the world as they see fit like a massive training ground to make their troops grow in strength.

Once Ryan returned to Isis palace, he found the original three members of the alliance and the other elder gods looking at a map of the entire world. That map had thousands of points that marked the location of all dungeons. Ryan recalled that he wanted something like that in the past. Either way, it seemed that they wanted to divide their forces to take care of the dungeons since it would be the most effective way to gain resources.

"You appeared at the right time," Isis said. "Is there any particular dungeon you would like to use?"

"No, I think I will have my hands full dealing with four generals," Ryan replied. "That being said, it would be nice to have the chance to clear some dungeons that will grant the classes that I don't have yet."

"We already prepared for that, right now, we are thinking of the best way to rotate the troops all over the world as fast as possible, in order to grant them the chances to obtain as many classes as possible," Isis said. "Soon enough, we should have a list with the intel that will show us what classes the dungeons all over the world will grant."

"That would be really useful, I will wait patiently," Ryan said.

Most of the time, moving and working as a group was a pain since Ryan couldn't do whatever he wanted all the time. Still, in moments like these, it sure was helpful to have so many resourceful allies. However, just thinking about what would happen to the world once they deal with those three was enough to make Ryan feel a headache. After all, the world will be filled with super-powered humans. Hopefully, the elder gods won't try world domination again, and humans won't get blind by the idea of power.

After that, Ryan left to his room and then entered the Void World. He saw once again the demons trying to attack Femradiel at the same time. Still, they were having a hard time approaching since she was emitting an aura cold enough that made them tremble the more they approached.

Before they could notice Ryan's presence, he bombarded them with Deceleration Crossbow and Golden Arrows. The demons frowned when they were hit by behind. Without Time Skip, the amount of damage Ryan could cause wasn't that high, so he decided to use Cannon Arrow and Gravity Arrow when they approached. The demons clenched their teeth when the attacks suddenly got more powerful and made them heavier, but Ryan wasn't satisfied with that he wanted to deal with all of them using normal projectiles and without using mana.

"You are late" Femradiel said and then sighed. "At least they made me get used to fighting more than one enemy at the same time. Is everything all right outside?"

"Yes, you can rest now," Ryan said. "Still, I think it would be beneficial to us if you could make the Ice Tyrant and Furball help on the clean up of the demons."

"I was planning to do that," Femradiel said. "I will return later after doing that and taking a nap. They are so noisy that I am kind of tired."

"Got it," Ryan said. "Well then, let's have some fun."
