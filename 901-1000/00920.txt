Chapter 921: The Four Angels

Chapter 921: The four angels

"Thank you for receiving us, Michael," Isis said. "We have a lot to talk about and too little time."

"... tell me how you discovered about the location of the four demons," Michael said with an authoritative tone.

"I have knowledge of the future, so I can tell where they are considering the position of their troops," Femradiel said.

"That is absurd," Michael said. "No mere human would have that kind of power."

"But I have the knowledge, not the power," Femradiel said. "I also know that your Holy Knights won't get strong enough to give you the chance to win the war against Chronus, Ymir, and Lucifer. You will resist for a while, but then"

"How did you know about the Holy Knights? They are being trained, and their existence hasn't been exposed yet," Michael said.

"Because I am from the future, I also know how you make the holy knights, but I don't think you would like to hear me say that out loud," Femradiel said.

Instead of that, Femradiel used Telepathy and told him that the holy knights are created the same way a human being receives draconic powers. By making a pact with an angel. Much in the same manner, humans obtain a lot of power according to the level of Angelic Transformation.

"I can't see evil or lies in your eyes," Michael said. "You really came from the future"

"We don't have time to talk about that," Isis declared. "We need to discuss once again the possibility of us joining our forces to defeat our enemies. You want Lucifer dead, and we want a universe where we don't have to fear Ymir and Chronus. If we work together, we might be able to defeat them separately, in case they come to this planet again, together. However, for that to happen, we will have to prepare together. No matter what happens, we can't let them turn this world into the battlefield chosen by them."

Truth to be told, Michael didn't care in the least about Chronus and Ymir. Since they didn't dispose of Lucifer, he assumed that they weren't that troublesome. So, as long as they defeat Lucifer, they will eventually dispose of those two as well. However, things weren't that simple. Unfortunately, Michael couldn't see that. He was a practical being. He knew that Lucifer had to be defeated and was working with that single goal in mind.

"In the future, your holy knights had almost fifty years to train and reach the apex of their strength with Angelic Transformation, but they never did it," Femradiel said. "You will have even less time in this timeline. Half of the Norse and Greek gods have been defeated, so it is only a matter of time before the planet becomes the center of their attention again. You need to make your choice as soon as possible."

"In two days, we will receive an answer from Zeus and Odin as well," Isis said. "Even after we defeat them, we realize that we will need their strength to win this battle against those beings. Once we deal with this bigger problem, we can return to the times where we didn't get along with each other, and we might again, but right now, we need to focus on what is important."

Ryan couldn't help but wonder if Isis and Athena had planned to do that when they decided to become allies. Defeat many enemies and then convince them to work with them for the sake of the world. The elder gods also wanted to protect the planet, but they didn't listen to others because they were at the top. After being defeated, they weren't anymore.

" I will need to talk with the other three angels," Michael said. "While I am their leader, I believe that I can't make this decision myself. I will ask their opinions about this possible alliance, and then I will give you the answer in two day's time as well."

"All right," Isis said.

After that, Michael disappeared. Considering that the angels refused an alliance before because they had Ryan on their side, he sure looked calm. Ryan imagined that he would be more hostile, and that might even pick up a fight, but that didn't even get close to happening. Maybe it was because Michael was more interested in the things they knew, or perhaps it was due to the fact that Ryan didn't look that devilish despite having Belphegor's powers. Come to think of it, Ryan noticed that he wasn't on edge anymore.

"Let's return and continue with our preparations," Isis said. "For the time being, we will wait for their answers, and after that, I think we should focus on making contact with the other humans and the other leaders. We will be a lot more influential if Zeus, Odin, and Micheal decide to work with us."

Again, Ryan thought that things were proceeding too fast, considering that they just fought almost to death with so many elder gods. It was also weird that the possibility of having more allies and fewer enemies was making him have less free time. Regardless, instead of worrying endlessly about things like that, Ryan decided to clear some dungeons. Meanwhile, Femradiel went to check things with Alissa, she had fought against many demons, and she was also helping her friends in China, so she had a lot of work lately.
