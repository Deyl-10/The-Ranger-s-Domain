Chapter 981: Greed Defiance Crossbow

Eventually, Ryan finally finished fixing his build. However, before proceeding, he created a new crossbow using the power of the Greed Demon God class.

Greed Defiance Crossbow

Effect: at the cost of one hundred thousand coins, it grants you the power to fire a bolt that will hit the enemy no matter what..

Dexterity + 700, Intelligence + 300.

Durability: 600/600

"I see Lucifer must use a power like that all the time to fight me," Chronus said. "He is good at hiding that kind of thing, so I never understood how he could do that."

Ryan didn't say anything. He just raised his chin and then summoned Diamond Crossbow. He began to pull the trigger as he dashed toward Chronus and the speed of the projectiles made even Chronus frown. They were flying so fast that the attraction was making them slowly fall apart along the way that showed that Ryan's skill and power reached a level beyond the power of the basic level of the seven deadly sins.

Chronus didn't try to dodge them. Instead, he grabbed all the bolts with his bare hands, but he ended up regretting that. Every time he did that, his hands were cut, and he started to bleed. The damage still was minimal, but he could tell Ryan could destroy entire mountains with a single one of those. Not to mention, the effects and damage were piling up since Ryan activated Vital Hunter whenever he fired those. Chronus' near-infinite endurance was decreasing.

"I congratulate you, for finally forcing me to use this," Chronus said and then finally opened his eyes.

" Shut up," Ryan said in a cold tone.

Ryan was expecting something to change once Chronus opened his eyes. Still, the surprise had been more shocking than he could imagine. The moment his bolts approached and entered Chronus' line of sight, they turned into dust. It seemed Chronus could make things age just by looking at them that was some messed up power.

Ryan ignored that and just increased the firing rate until Chronus' vision was filled with bolts. Naturally, Chronus made those disappear, and they moved his left arm to block Ryan's next attack even from a distance, he created a dark ice arrow and fired at point-blank range on Chronus.

"He can do even this now, that is good" Chronus said while looking at his hand, emitting steam thanks to the fact that he was just holding the arrow.

Chronus thought that just opening his eyes would make him get rid of the annoying projectiles, but he was wrong. He could only make disappear the bolts fire by the weapon on Ryan's hands, and that was its major weakness. Ryan bombarded Chronus from all angles with Golden Arrows.

In the end, Chronus blocked them by using Temporal Shield. There was no point in holding back against Ryan anymore Chronus flew toward Ryan and then tried to grab his neck. Still, Ryan moved away by firing numerous bolts while Evading Shot was active. Although that was a speed that Chronus had no problems following it, he was forced to slow down on his charge. He tried to attack while ignoring defense, and thanks, he got bit by some of Ryan's bolts he had used his newest crossbow, after all. Chronus stopped and checked his body. The wounds were small, but they were making him bleed a little.

"An undoumitable greed that ignores even the effects of time, huh," Chronus muttered.

"Don't worry, this is just a temporary trick," Ryan said. "I won't be satisfied in defeating you, unless I use your ability against you."

It seemed that Ryan was getting carried away, but Chronus knew that it wasn't true. The reason was the fact that he was constantly activating and deactivating Money Physics so that he wouldn't suffer critical damage if he made even the smallest of mistakes. Not to mention, even though he used tons of coins to increase his dexterity, he still had a few billion left to use for defense.

When Chronus looked at Ryan, he felt him activating Money Physics even with that skill, he will only last around ten minutes. That was the time Chronus had to go all out, not because of the coins, but because the other two finally noticed that he was fighting for real. Chronus moved his left arm backward and prepared a punch. At that moment, Ryan felt shivers.

Congratulations! The Skill Death Sense has leveled up.

Ryan summoned two hundred copies of Spiritualist's Crossbow pointed toward Chronus and then fired. He knew that he would use Time Skip, and he did it. Ryan managed to decrease the power of the attack by using his bolts, but in the end, a single ultra-charged punch hit him and made him fly to outer space in a single moment.

Ryan stopped spinning when he left the planet, but he was barely able to stay conscious due to the pain. Once again, all his bones were broken. To think that a single charged attack would make him lose all the coins he had saved for defense

In the blink of an eye, Ryan left Earth and even the moon behind. It was almost a miracle that he survived an attack and while he was moving that fast. Fortunately, by using Evading Shot in the opposite direction, he managed to slow down. For some reason Chronus didn't follow him.

"That guy" Ryan bit his lips in exasperation when he used Clairvoyance and saw Chronus resuming his extermination.

The elder gods began to fight him again, but Chronus wasn't pulling any punches this time. If only Ryan still had that mana pool Ryan suddenly had an idea. He used Void World and then made Self-Replication level up many times. Once he could summon one hundred replicas, he made them use Zen in the Void World. How did Ryan recover enough mana and coins to do all that? He used Diamond Crossbow on the moon and turned a good part of it into mana and coins.
