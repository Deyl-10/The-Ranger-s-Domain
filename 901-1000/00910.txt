Chapter 911: Learning Speed

Chapter 911: Learning speed

When Ares cut Athena down, he immediately understood that something was off. She had activated Vengeful Explosion at the last moment. She made Ares suffer the same amount of damage, but since he was sturdier, he would survive, but as for Athena

While he was bleeding from his left side with a big wound. Ares watched Athena fall. He was sure that he had split her in two, and yet, her presence was still there. Her armor fell off, split in two, but Athena didn't die Ares then saw the wound in Athena's body already closed. It seemed it had been cauterized, but how? How could have she done that so fast? Even if that was what kept her alive, it didn't explain how she healed the interior of her body. At that moment, Ares noticed that the armor had fallen, but the backside of the armor was still intact.

"You are faster than me, Ares," Athena said while pointing toward her eyes. "But too predictable. After attacking me so much, I memorized all the timing of your body. Even if you grow stronger and faster, you can't escape my eyes and my reflexes not anymore."

Ares ignored that nonsense and then tried to heal himself. It was annoying, but it couldn't be helped. However, before he could do anything, Athena created the Electric Arrows near his eyes and attacked. As if that wasn't enough, she dashed toward him and swung her sword. Mana Armor protected Ares, but the Electric Arrows prevented him from seeing Athena entirely.

Athena's full swings made Ares lose a lot of mana in the blink of an eye. He had time to heal himself and close the wound, but he lost a lot of blood while Athena was bothering him. Thanks to that, even though his status was increasing, he could feel his body weaker than before.

Ares decided that it was time for payback, but the constant Electric Arrow trying to hit his eyes messed up with his rhythm. Even though he was supposed to be faster, Athena was always one step ahead of him. As if that wasn't troublesome enough, after dodging, she always returned with a big swing that took another chunk of Ares' mana it was painful for him to admit it. Still, it was thanks to that spell that Athena didn't have his head yet.

"She wasn't joking she really memorized all my timing," Ares clenched his teeth in annoyance. "As if that isn't enough, she is creating those annoying arrows to mess with my field vision."

Ares realized that Athena could only create so many arrows so close from his body because she knew his timing all-too-well. That explained her quick counterattacks previously. Before he could find a way out of that mess, Ares' mana reached the bottom.

"Shit" Ares muttered in anger.

His statuses and body grew yet again, but not enough to solve that mess. In the end, Ares was forced to resort to his triumph card or at least a weaker version since he had too little mana to use. Dark flames in the shape of wings appeared behind Ares's armor and also covered his sword. It was supposed to cover his entire armor with its full power, but he couldn't since Athena made sure to spend all the little mana he had.

"I can't sense corruption still, you managed to empower one of your skills with the power of a deadly sin," Athena said.

Instead of saying anything, Ares just dashed toward Athena, which made her realize that he didn't have any energy left to defend. That skill probably won't last for long either. Regardless, when Ares' sword touched Athena's shield, she felt a massive impact that made her fly and spin in the air like no before. She felt her energy being drained, her health, mana, and stamina while her left arm's bones were cracking. Those dark flames did more than just increase Ares' power.

However, when Ares attacked again, he was welcomed by sword Electric Arrows in the eyes. Even when Athena was spinning in the air, she could counterattack like that. Ares raised his shield to block the attack, and that gave Athena the opening to pierce his stomach with her electric enhanced sword. Unfortunately, it seemed that the spell also increased Ares' endurance and mentality the sword only pierced two centimeters of Area's skin.

Athena eventually recovered since Ares couldn't attack and leave his eyes unprotected at the same time. However, she didn't have much time to rest since Ares was in a race against time. He dashed toward her even though his shield was blocking his shield of vision. Even though Ares wasn't that good of a tracker, he could still sense Athena's divinity and attack using that alone. That strategy was simple but highly effective. Athena knew that before she could lose the ability to move her left arm, she had to do something.

Athena charged her sword with electric enchantment and then prepared to throw it. Ares liked to see her trying to struggle like that, but he didn't plan to let her do what she was planning. She charged toward her, and then Athena threw her sword instead of blocking with his shield. Ares drained the weapon's energy upon impact with his own sword and then smirked as he approached Athena. Still, then he was forced to stop when she made dozens of those arrows appear around his body he couldn't protect himself against so many. So, Ares only clenched his teeth and waited for the pain. The pain came, but not alone Ares assumed that the paralysis would only last for a moment, but then he was hit from above by dozens of Zeus's Bolts.

"What" Ares opened his eyes widely when he was hit by those.

Ares lost the ability to move his body due to the shock and the effects of the attack. He couldn't see Zeus's presence nearby, and he couldn't find any reason why his father would attack him at the moment. He saw Athena raising both her arms upward and preparing to fire Zeus's Lightning in the next moment. It was hard to believe, but it seemed that Athena learned those while they were fighting
