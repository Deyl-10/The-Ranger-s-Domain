Chapter 906: Speedster

A few hours before that massive explosion

As soon as Athena heard from Isis about the new plan, she noticed that Femradiel appeared standing above one of the many mountains of that region. Although she had a job to do, Femradiel was looking toward the West as if she was waiting for something to come from that direction.

"My apologies for this," Athena said via telepathy.

"There is no need for apologies," Femradiel said. "This is a situation beyond our wild expectations, and it is not like I am worried or anything. I am just hoping that that idiot won't do anything stupid."

As soon as she said that, Femradiel noticed two powerful presences appearing nearby where Ryan was. When she saw the lightning bolts falling from the sky and hitting Ryan thanks to Clairvoyance, she also saw Zeus and Thor. Those two made the hair of her back stand fighting against them at the same time was suicide. She had planned to use Teleport and then go help, but she was forced to stop when she felt two presences heading in that direction. One of them approached her, and the other moved toward where Athena was.

Hermes was a middle-aged man that was wearing light armor. His hair was silver, just like the color of his eyes. It was quite a weird tone Regardless, he was completely unarmed, but Femradiel recognized the winged helmet and the winged sandals that only one Greek god was supposed to have.

Ares, on the other hand, really seemed like a troublesome foe. He was wearing a full plate dark armor that protected every single bit of his body. His hair and eyes were light-brown, but they seemed red like blood against certain sources of light. Aside from those, his big round shield and his long sword made him stand out more. They kind of looked like the same weapons as Athena.

"You shouldn't ignore those who came to greet you, missy," Hermes said. "That is quite disrespectful toward those that came from so far away."

Femradiel looked at Hermes and couldn't help but frown. He didn't have an aura of a true warrior, and due to that, she couldn't get motivated. Naturally, she knew that he wasn't weak, but he didn't seem like a particularly troublesome enemy either.

According to what Athena revealed, Hermes was the fastest of the Olympian gods. Apparently, not even Zeus, when he was serious, could win against him. However, Athena also said that Hermes wasn't a warrior per se. He was a different kind of enemy

"Let's get this over with," Femradiel declared.

After hearing that, Hermes' expression changed. He looked pretty carefree before, but now he was pissed. More than anything, he hated those who looked down on him just because they assumed that he was the weakest god of Olympus.

Hermes disappeared, and in the next moment, Femradiel felt a sharp pain on her chin. She didn't see what attacked her, but she knew that it hadn't been a weak attack when she began to spin in the air. She tried to stop it, but before she could actually try, something began to hit her from all directions. Every time she got hit, she felt her bones cracking and the direction she was flying changed as well.

Congratulations! The skill Pain Resistance has leveled up.

"That confirms it" Femradiel muttered.

It seemed that Hermes was planning to end the fight as soon as possible. That was why he wasn't stopping to rest. Despite that, he failed to notice that Femradiel was yet to receive any critical damage.

When Hermes noticed that Femradiel wasn't showing any signs of being in pain, he stopped and gave her the chance to recover and stop spinning. He looked at her body and saw the marks of his punches, but they were weirdly shallow

Before Hermes could wonder why Femradiel fired several Ice Spears toward him. Naturally, Hermes just moved to the side slightly and dodged those. Although from his perspective, he just walked, Femradiel only saw his image disappearing somewhere and appearing somewhere else.

Femradiel insisted and fired other spears, but she also used Perfect Aim and Deadly Aim this time. Hermes noticed that and just shrugged such a simple trick. Instead of running away and letting the number of spears chasing him increase, Hermes just let those hit him.

Femradiel frowned when she saw the spears being destroyed when they approached Hermes. One after the other, they began to crumble apart when they approached. The power of those was supposed to be equal to meteors, and yet Hermes didn't move from his spot. He really had another type of strength, and yet Femradiel let out a sigh.

Hermes bit his lips in annoyance and prepared to attack again. Still, before he could do it, he saw Femradiel emitting a cold Aura from her body. Hermes could feel a lot of mana from her, so it was definitely a spell. Despite her attitude, Femradiel obviously was taking the fight seriously. Thanks to that, Hermes calmed down a little bit.

"Is she planning to damage me like that since she can't keep up with my speed?" Hermes wondered.

Many enemies used the same strategy before. It was only logical since attacking directly was impossible against an opponent so fast. It was better to rely on the area of effect spells. The defensive ones were quite effective since Hermes had to get closer to the attack. However, that strategy was very flawed Hermes could always approach, attack, cause much more damage than he could receive in a single instant.
