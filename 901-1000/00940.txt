Chapter 941: Moon Lord

As soon as Ryan used his mana to activate the Checkpoint, he noticed the spare around him changing instantly. Unlike when he used Teleport, he saw the fabric of space-changing before his eyes. He frowned when he saw a vast green camp that extended endlessly toward the horizon. It seemed like a planet full of life that had never seen war. Such thoughts disappeared from Ryan's mind when he felt several powerful presences around and when he turned, he saw several white temples that made him recall those from Greece.

"What a nice breeze" Ryan said as he felt his mind being filled with inner peace.

Ryan blinked a few times when suddenly Poseidon and Thanatos appeared in front of him. Of the enemies that he had fought in the past, those two were the ones who clearly wanted to have their rev someday. Despite that, they didn't try to attack Ryan.

"What are you doing here?" Poseidon asked without trying to hide his blood lust.

"Artemis and Apollo called for me," Ryan replied, completely ignoring those eyes filled with hatred.

While they were allies, Ryan could understand and knew that Poseidon would never forgive him. After all, his royal guard was composed of his sons, after all. Not to mention, the leader was the kid he had with Aphrodite. That being said, Ryan had no reason whatsoever to ask for forgiveness. They captured Femradiel and tried to kill her.

"I think this is enough," A silver-haired woman suddenly appeared and said. "We all know that not a single one of us here will dare to shed blood in this world, but emitting such killing intent is also unbefitting of you, Poseidon."

Ryan didn't have to use Absolute Appraisal to see that it was Artemis. She kind of made Ryan remind of Athena, but she looked more serene with her long silver hair and eyes. She wasn't wearing a single piece of armor, but Ryan could feel a lot of mana coming from her robe.

"So, this is the best archer that the humans had," A redhead man suddenly appeared and studied Ryan from head to toe. "I can't see how he defeated Zeus."

Apollo was like the opposite of Artemis. His red hair and eyes showed how wild he was. Considering that he was the god of the sun, it made a lot of sense that he was like that. Apollo also was wearing light red armor that emitted some fire in the borders. It was enough to make Ryan not stare at it for too long.

"Don't take your time talking with him," Poseidon said and then disappeared.

Thanatos glared at Ryan for a while, but then he eventually disappeared as well. They should know better than Ryan wasn't someone who could be scared that easily

"I apologize for their rudeness and I thank you for coming here," Artemis said.

"Let's not waste time here, we have better things to do than waste time talking," Apollo said. "I can see that despite not having lived long, you have the eyes of a true archer. Even though you don't have the presence of someone who defeated Zeus."

Ryan wondered why he was repeating that. In any case, he decided to stay quiet and see how things would play out.

"Can we ask you a favor?" Artemis asked.

"As long as it doesn't take too much of my time" Ryan said.

"We would like to see your battle against Zeus," Artemis said. "We understand that you don't have the skills to show us a part of your memories, so I am willing to bestow upon you the skill necessary."

Before he could say anything, Ryan received that skill from Artemis. It seemed like a skill that could be helpful to make his allies train using his own memories, or at least experience certain situations and get used to them. However, Ryan didn't come to receive that Still, in the end, he decided to show them without making much of a fuss. If he were to gain anything, he would have to start with a good impression It was hard to imagine that Ryan could improve his image, though. He defeated several Greek gods, after all.

Usually, it would take a while for Ryan to transmit the memories of the battle. Still, he speeds things up by using Mana Manipulation. That made the skill level up pretty fast as well, so Ryan only had to wait for twenty minutes. Once the memories ended, Ryan noticed that Artemis and Apollo looked equally troubled.

"You didn't use an arrow on your last attack," Artemis said.

Ryan rolled his eyes they were complaining because Ryan used a spear instead of an arrow that was so stupid that he let out a long sigh.

"Nevertheless you fought as an archer and defeated Zeus as an archer," Artemis said. "You deserve to have my power."

"This isn't what we agreed with, Artemis!" Apollo protested. "We agreed that he would choose one of us to receive power!"
