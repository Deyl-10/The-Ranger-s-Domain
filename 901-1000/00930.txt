Chapter 931: Cheat

Ryan imagined himself using Wolf's Greed without any restrictions be able to use it in any situation, as many times as possible against the same opponent while using other skills It was so unfair that Ryan could only think that it was a lie.

"Considering that, it is safe to say that he doesn't need other skills to fight equally against Ymir and Chronus," Ryan said.

"Yep," Loki asked.

"Any idea how to counter those powers?" Ryan asked.

"None," Loki replied. "Logic says that attacking him with everything is the best way to defeat him. However, the effects of Gluttony turns him into a pile of near-infinite health."

"The angels powers are like poison to Lucifer, so they will be many times more effective than us, at least when it comes to Raphael, Michael, Uriel, and Gabriel," Athena said. "I tried to think of other ways, but their fight is bound to end in a war of attrition."

"That doesn't sound so bad, as long as we defeat his generals, that is," Ryan said.

"However there is that power that Femradiel mentioned," Athena said.

Ryan nodded Lucifer can turn humans into Cursed dragons. Most likely, those who were working directly under the Angels are immune to the corruption, but everyone else

"I think that defeating Lucifer as soon as possible might determine our success or failure," Athena said. "I believe that he is the easiest enemy among the three, but he is also the one who can cause the most damage to our troops."

The damage she was referring to was his power to turn humans into dragons. Not only would it decrease their forces, but it also would grant Lucifer very powerful minions. Ryan knew that very well because he relied on his Cursed form to win some fights. According to Femradiel's reports, apparently, Ryan got five times stronger whenever he lost his mind. On the bright side, elder gods couldn't become cursed dragons, but on the bad side their powers will be transferred to those that might defeat them, making the fight even harder the more they fall.

"We aren't making much progress here," Ryan said. "What are the chances of the archangels or of the other elder gods come up with some solution?"

"You shouldn't expect much of a solution regarding Lucifer coming from Odin and Zeus," Loki said. "For thousands of years, they only had Ymir and Chronus in mind."

"Well, let's hope that their plan to defeat them is solid then," Ryan said.

While he didn't hear about a proper plan on how to defeat those three, at least now Ryan knew that he wasn't the only one having a hard time coming up with a plan. However, he had an idea maybe if he helps the angels first, he will have the chance to gain stupid amounts of coins if he uses Golden Arrow. Thus, he will be able to level up some classes.

After a while, Isis returned, and then she created another Checkpoint connecting the underground base and her palace. That skill sure was useful, considering that it was connecting two worlds that probably were light-years far apart from each other.

"Those who work with Daniel decided to work with us, so from this moment onward, we should help each other," Isis said. "Now, we just need to check things with Russia, Japan, and China. We don't have any contacts in India, so we will have to find another way to negotiate with them."

"While you say that we have a contact in China, it is only a single mana, and apparently, there are dozens of groups that have the same strength as him," Loki said. "While I do believe that many of the other groups will join him once they see us backing them up, I am sure that will cause some unrest as well. I can already hear the rumors mentioning the humans who joined the elder gods who attacked and destroyed many parts of the world."

"That can't be helped," Isis said. "We already knew that something like that would happen, but we didn't find any peaceful solution. Regardless, it seems that Femradiel is busy, so we will have to speed up things and talk with the leaders in Japan and Russia."

"There is no need to beat around the bush. I already know that I am the only one who can do that," Ryan said and then sighed.

While it was good to meet with his old friends again, Ryan was feeling too uneasy to enjoy those moments. After all, the real last battle was approaching, and not even with the possibility of creating a huge alliance with all the powerhouses of Earth made the elder gods feel confident in their victory. Without wasting any time, Ryan decided to go and do that job, but once he was alone, he decided to take a break.

"Merlin, you said that your creator created you to help humans, right?" Ryan asked. "That means that he is, or he was free of worries right now?"

"Probably, I can't tell since I haven't met him in a long while," Merlin said.

"Did he have to endure the same things as we did here?" Ryan asked.

"I can't answer that question," Merlin replied. "Anything related to my creator's life is mostly confidential."

Ryan sighed. He had thought that perhaps he could obtain some intel from someone who probably survived a similar situation and got rid of all possible enemies that threatened his world. Naturally, that would be too good to be true. In any case, considering what he heard, Ryan assumed that Merlin's creator probably didn't live in that universe. If he lived, he would be someone who could face Lucifer, Chronus, and Ymir.

"All I can say is that he created me because he knew other places would have to endure the same or worse ordeals," Merlin said. "He fought for too long, and he didn't want to spend the rest of his existence fighting. That is why he created me."
