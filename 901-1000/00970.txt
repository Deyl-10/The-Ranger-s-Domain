Chapter 971: Changing The Future

Chapter 971: Changing the future

"If you don't believe me, then I have something to say. I know about Femradiel's secret because I have experienced that timeline as well," Chronus said. "I had high hopes for the human called Arthur, but in the end, he failed. Even when he used a small fraction of my power, the only thing he managed to do was to accelerate the doom of this planet in another timeline."

Until now, Femradiel managed to keep her cool, but after hearing that, her face turned pale, and she began to tremble. Ryan looked at Isis, and she seemed nervous like never before.

"I understand that many of you might think that this is nonsense. There is no way that the destiny of the universe is set in stone. It is what you are thinking," Chronus said. "That is why I am going to summon your consciences from the future. You will see everything that will happen in the blink of an eye. You might be thinking that it will be an illusion to make all of you give up, but if the system doesn't warn you of that, it will be proof enough."

Ryan and all the elder gods Teleported to that region. They couldn't understand why Chronus was doing all that. Still, they wanted to confirm that their allies wouldn't fall for any trap. In the blink of an eye, Ryan and all the others saw the future. Soon after talking with Chronus for a while, the white group returned to their base since Chronus decided to just watch instead of intervening. After a couple of hours, Lucifer returns, and this time he doesn't hold back and ends up killing half of the Holy Knights and Michael. Ryan joined the fight, but he did it too late. Thousands of humans began when Lucifer used his Greed to directly damage humans. Somehow, just by using coins, he managed to make thousands die.

Ryan began to fight without holding back, and the three remaining angels worked with him. They managed to keep Lucifer busy, but then Ymir showed up and began to spread destruction as well. Ryan, who hadn't used Draconic Transformation until that moment, finally went all out against Lucifer. Thanks to the massive reservoir of mana Femradiel has built up, he fought against him one on one. However, it was evident that Lucifer wasn't giving his best. After a couple of hours, Lucifer got tired of playing with Ryan, and then he used some sort of Transformation skill that made him bigger and more powerful. In his new form, Lucifer really looked like the king of the demons. He was as big as a dragon, and his whole skin was in a weird color between green and blue, but what was important was the crazy level of endurance he had obtained. Not even by using Time Skip in the max output, Ryan couldn't damage Lucifer.

In the end, Lucifer grabbed Ryan by the neck and broke it as if he was made of cotton

When Ryan blinked, he returned to the real world. Femradiel still was seeing something probably because Ryan died much before her. In any case, there was no mistake. When Ryan checked his statuses, he confirmed that the classes had leveled up and he had gotten stronger. Chronus' power was insane so, how in the hell he still couldn't beat Ymir and Lucifer?

"That is how each one of you will die," Chronus declared. "Your Illusion Resistance didn't warn you, and you obtained the battle experience of the future. That only confirms what I said. This is what will happen this time."

"I refuse to accept that," Athena said. "We will defeat them."

"Without a proper plan, nothing will change. Even though you also saw some of their techniques, there is nothing you can do against them," Chronus said. "You might change the future a little bit with the knowledge and the power you just obtained, but in the end, you will only prevent your deaths for a few minutes. You can say that the future isn't set in stone, but big events are a culmination of uncountable small events. Once those take place, it is impossible to prevent the result."

All the Greek elder gods had come to fight, but just a few minutes of talk made them lose all the will to fight. They realized that they truly saw the future, and the reason for that was the fact that some of them could use Foresight.

Little by little, Ryan was also getting convinced that it was the truth. The human race and Earth were doomed However, Ryan changed his mind when he saw Arthur and Zoe holding each other's hands amidst that massive number of survivors. They were trembling uncontrollably it was only natural since they were kids and just saw their deaths. Ryan couldn't let such young kids live such a short life

Ryan had planned to use Memory Manipulation to revive those events and gain the experience over and over again. Still, the skill didn't grant him the effects that he had desired. So, Ryan made Arthur level up Foresight up to level two hundred by using five billion coins. After that, he activated Foresight and then used Mana Manipulation to amplify the effects of the skill. After a couple of minutes, he found the moments where he fought Lucifer. He saw the same scenes repeating themselves again and again. However, he didn't give up. While people were giving to despair, Ryan was using the future filled with despair to gain power. While he was using the stupid amount of mana, he also was gaining a stupid amount of strength. In the end, he saw his battle against Lucifer getting longer and longer. At that point, Chronus noticed that Ryan was slowly changing the future...
