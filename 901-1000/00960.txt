Chapter 961: Do What You Can

Chapter 961: Do what you can

In the end, Ryan decided to accept the risk. He didn't feel the need until now of learning Perfect Replication, probably due to its cost, but now it was absolutely necessary.

When Ryan obtained the class, he felt Ymir's eyes moving toward him. Until now, he looked toward the battles without showing any motivation. He even still was with his arms crossed, but his neutral expression broke a little when he saw Ryan and his status.

"You who are you?" Ymir asked.

Ryan thought Ymir was looking at him, but he was looking toward Merlin, even though he was in his stealth mode, where no one could see him.

"How do you do, my name is Merlin," Merlin said.

"I can feel a different aura in you is very similar to the aura that Lucifer has," Ymir said.

Ryan and everyone else frowned when they heard that. Why would Merlin's presence be like Lucifer? And why did the Angels never mention that?

"Merlin What the hell is he talking about?" Ryan asked.

"Ah, I see now" Merlin said. "Everything makes sense now."

"What makes sense?" Ryan frowned.

"Sorry, but I can't explain," Merlin said. "If I answer this we all will have to deal with some trouble. You might find this weird, but later on, you will understand that I am helping you by keeping quiet about certain things."

Ryan indeed felt that weird, but in the end, it wasn't time to doubt Merlin's reasons. Until now, Merlin didn't do anything that prejudiced Ryan. In fact, he saved his life after he fought Zeus. So, Ryan felt that he could trust Merlin.

In any case, it would be troublesome if Ymir were to create a copy of Merlin as well, not that he needed more power. Still, if he creates a copy of Ryan that is auxiliated by a copy of Merlin as well things will get messy.

"What is your history, little one?" Ymir asked. "Just like Lucifer, and I can't read your history. Tell me why that isn't possible."

"As much as I would want to do that, I will have to refuse," Merlin said.

"Very well, I will destroy this human's spirit and then force you to tell me the secret behind you and Lucifer's existence," Ymir said.

"Can you please stop saying his name all the time?" Merlin asked.

Ymir ignored that and then made the space around them change. For a second, Ryan felt that he had returned to the Void World, but then he realized that he was in the same place as before. The only difference is that everyone around had disappeared.

"Mindscape Materialization" Merlin said. "Be careful, Ryan. Now you truly will fight on Ymir turf and no one will be able to help you."

Judging by the name alone, Ryan could tell the nature of that skill. Still, to think that he would be summoned to fight alone and he wouldn't be able to resist the summoning. that was beyond annoying.

"You don't have to worry," Ymir said. "If you satisfy my curiosity for a little bit, I will retreat for today. Naturally, I won't fight you today, you made me realize that the humans of this world changed a lot while I was unaware."

"Well thank you for your generosity," Ryan said and then forced a smile.

"Time here also passes faster than reality, but I am not Chronus so my power over time is limited," Ymir said. "Defeat the spectral copy as soon as possible and you won't have to see your allies dead when you return to the real world."

Ymir created a copy made of shadows of Ryan. It was really creepy to see himself like that since it looked like Ryan was watching his dark side taking shape. Regardless, Ymir was playing with him, but that was a good chance.

Ryan summoned dozens of copies of his Spiritualist's Crossbow in a single instant and then bombarded the copy. Still, the creature repeated his same actions rendering his plan worthless. Ryan summoned the Chaotic Hunger Crossbow, and Ymir frowned when he felt a tiny fraction of Lucifer's powers. Nevertheless, the copy mimicked Ryan's movements, but his shadow bolts were eaten by Ryan's.

"That thing can't copy everything, I suppose" Ryan said when he saw the copy jumping backward.

Ryan attacked the creature non-stop, forcing him to dodge all bolts. The creature knew that it would suffer some damage by getting hit by a projectile with those properties. That made Ryan understand that Ymir, Lucifer, and Chronus couldn't replicate each other abilities, or perhaps they could, but didn't want to make one of them feel the pleasure of that. After all, it would be the same as assuming that their powers were incomplete.

"Merlin," Ryan said via Telepathy. "Can you analyze Ymir's abilities while we fight like this?"

"He isn't doing much fighting, but I suppose I can try to analyze this summoning technique of his," Merlin replied. "It might take a while, though. "It goes without saying, but it is the ultimate level of summoning."

"Just do what you can," Ryan said.

Suddenly, the copy made several Solar Arrows fall from the sky. Even though that place didn't exist in reality, Ryan saw massive explosions happening and the ground being covered in flames whenever he dodged those projectiles. Apparently, Ymir refused to copy Lucifer and Chronus' power. Still, something like the skills of the elder gods didn't bother him.

"This kind of reasoning is weird as hell, but I don't care I need to analyze this power, so maybe I should slow down a little bit," Ryan thought.

Still, was it a good idea to slow down the fight? His allies were still fighting outside, and Ryan would not see any changes if Ymir decided to use other tactics
