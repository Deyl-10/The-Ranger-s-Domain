Chapter 901: No Idea

Chapter 901: No idea

After thinking for a while, Ryan came up with a strategy to prevent Zeus from growing stronger. While he wouldn't gain any mana from that, it was better than letting him become even more troublesome. Without wasting time, Ryan summoned thirty-four magic copies of his spiritualist crossbow. It was the maximum amount he could summon, considering the level of the skill. Before pulling the triggers, Ryan activated Light Speed, Perfect Aim, and Deadly Aim. The massive barrage of bolts flew toward Zeus, and he confirmed the weird feeling that he had been feeling Ryan had the skills to become troublesome. That is why he had to eliminate him as fast as possible. After all, he just came up with that combination, a combination that Zeus would be unable to dodge or dispose of without using a massive amount of mana.

In order not to waste any time and to make Ryan unable to recover any of the mana spent, Zeus created a shield of made lightning and blocked the bolts. The shield consumed Zeus' mana for quite a while since the bolts were eating away its energy. Still, eventually, Ryan was forced to stop.

"It won't be easy, just as I had expected" Ryan muttered. "However, there is no doubt that Zeus used more mana defending should I risk it and see who runs out of mana first?"

To answer that question, Ryan needed to learn for how long that massive thunder cloud will replenish Zeus' energy and if Hera had planned something else. Both of them underestimated Ryan once, but they won't do it again.

Both Zeus and Ryan looked quite troubled in how to deal with each other, but in the end, it seemed that Zeus found an answer sooner than Ryan. After letting out a long sigh, Zeus looked at Ryan, and the air around him began to change. He moved his right forward, and then massive amounts of mana began to gather there. After a while, the mana changed it is natural and then became lightning. It was weird, though. The spell didn't have a shape where it would be convenient to throw it. It was because it wasn't made to be throw the energy eventually stabilized until it became pretty round. Once that happened, Zeus created the sphere that entered his left chest.

Ryan frowned when he saw all that, but he frowned even more, when he saw Zeus' body trembling uncontrollably. It was only obvious that something like that would happen who would make so much condensed mana in that form enter their bodies? Regardless, Zeus' body began to change after all that trembling. His skin began to turn red like blood, and his whole body began to emit heat

"Crap it was a buff" Ryan muttered and then bit his lips.

Thanks to Odin's eye, Ryan could see the flow of mana around Zeus moving much faster than before. While that energy probably forced his heart to beat faster to increase his physical abilities, it was only obvious that it would enhance his magical capabilities as well. The worrisome thing was the fact that there was exist a spell that could put such a strain on the body of Zeus

Ryan threw his Dark Ice Spear to prevent Zeus' energy from stabilizing. He also fired multiple time Draconic Bow. No matter what happens, he can't let a being like that become even more powerful In the end, Ryan was forced to stop after firing five Draconic Bows in a quick succession because the massive and continuous explosion made him fly to the distance. The power of his attacks had been so massive that he saw the mana eating all everything around Zeus, be it ground, vegetation, mountains, and buildings.

In the end, Ryan clicked his tongue in annoyance when he recovered his balance. Not even using his best attacks five times like that made Zeus' presence grow weaker. It seemed that he was really screwed this time

Ryan prepared to use Draconic Bow again, but then he felt a slight sensation of his whole body growing numb. He thought that before when he used too much mana in a few instants. If he tries to use the same attack so fast again, he definitely will lose control over his body, and if that doesn't kill Zeus

Before Ryan could come up with an answer for that question. He suddenly felt a sharp pain coming from his chest. He saw the red Zeus with his right hand in his chest when he looked in that direction. He pulled a chunk of Ryan's body as if he had seen something that shouldn't be there.

Ryan teleported away from Zeus and began to sweat cold if he had wanted, Zeus could have pulled Ryan's heart with his right hand. What was that speed? Ryan's Light Speed was active, but he didn't see anything

"That expression suits you better," Zeus said without showing a hint of emotion on his face. "You forced me to use this technique, so at the very least, you should keep showing that expression to me until you die."

Maybe that was what Loki was referring to when he mentioned Zeus' true power. Ryan had assumed that he would some time to gain the strength that made him win the war against the titans, but it seemed that Zeus could speed up that process. It probably wasn't a safe thing to do, but he could do it if he wanted.

Nevertheless, Ryan had a big problem on his hands now. The enemy was finally showing its true power, and Ryan didn't have a single idea about how to counterattack that.
