Chapter 882: Sensing Hostility

Chapter 882: Sensing hostility

While Femradiel wanted to celebrate as soon as possible, she decided to be patient and wait for news on Isis and Athena's side. Even if they managed to decrease the number of enemies by seven in a single day, it didn't mean that they could celebrate if they lost one or two of the few allies that they had. After a while, though, they finally showed up and basically at the first time. Isis looked refreshed, but Athena looked troubled lately, she always looked troubled over something.

"It seems we all won this time. Good work, everyone," Isis said.

"I can't say that I won, though," Athena said with her arms crossed. "The leader of that army of demons never showed up, not even when I was fighting and ignoring my surroundings."

"Hmm it seems the demons were waiting for our sideshow some weakness," Isis concluded. "Since Lilith was defeated, their Eastern army wouldn't receive any help, even if they somehow defeated you. Regardless, it seems that all the Greek and Norse gods have withdrawn. This is a success. On the other hand I am pretty sure everyone already knows that Loki and Athena are on our side. Athena was pretty close to where Femradiel defeated Aphrodite, after all."

"A total withdrawn seems a bit too good to be true" Ryan frowned. "Knowing how bloodthirsty some of them can be, I expected that some of them would try to attack and recover the new weapons to free the elder gods."

"What do you know about this, Loki?" Isis asked.

"I got no clue," Loki shrugged.

When people starts to think they can rely on him, then he acts like that. Regardless, everyone knew that the situation still was a bit weird. The enemies won't fall for the same surprise attacks as before, so they had to be cautious.

"Well, we won the first day of this war, but there will be tougher battles in the future," Isis said. "Let's rest well, but without lowering our guard."

Ryan had been only awake for a few hours, but he felt like sleeping once again. Fortunately, his fever was nowhere to be seen, so it seemed that some hardcore exercise completely made him recover from whatever sickness that put him down on the bed for several weeks.

After spending so much time there, Ryan felt really comfortable in the patient's room, so he jumped into bed there and then prepared to sleep, but then Femradiel hugged him from behind. That wasn't bad, but it was a bit troublesome, anymore contact than that, and Ryan won't be able to keep his cool due to the softness he was feeling on his back thanks to Femradiel's natural armor that provided zero defense. Still, it was quite a sight for sore eyes.

"So, you are showing your true colors," Ryan said. "I am sorry, Femradiel, but we don't have time for that."

"Shut up. This is the reward that I demand," Feramdiel said.

"Well aren't you quite pure-hearted?" Ryan frowned. "I thought dragons were supposed to be symbols of the seven deadly sins in any case. I guess we can consider this a reward for me as well."

Furball, who had been standing on guard outside the city, finally returned. It seemed that he had felt the presence of his master and decided that it was time to rest as well. While the people and the monsters of that city didn't have to fight since morning, they still had a lot of work to do.

"Hey there, buddy," Ryan said. "If you notice that she is trying to brainwash me, you can lick her face without hesitation. Don't worry about the consequences. I got your back."

Femradiel looked at Furball like she was trying to tell with her eyes alone how she would punish him if he did that. Even without words, the threat had been highly effective since Furball lowered his head and then whined.

Using Sleep Manipulation, Ryan put himself to sleep, but not before he activated some skills. Thanks to Mana Control and Mana Magnetism, Ryan could obtain a lot of mana from the surroundings, so he used that to level up Void World while he slept. He had some coins that he gained after defeating Odin, but Ryan decided to save those to do something else.

Maybe it was due to his own magic that made him fall asleep easily, or perhaps it was due to the softness of Femradiel's boobs on his back. Ryan slept really well that night. Even while sleeping, he managed to make Void World reach level twenty, and he certainly will be able to use that on his daily routine. In any case, when he opened his eyes, he saw Merlin floating above him, and he realized that he would be a troublesome existence for reasons like that.

"I am sensing some hostility," Merlin said.

"Your sensors might be broken this isn't just hostility. It is plain killing intent," Ryan said. "Nevertheless can you make the calculations about how many coins I will need to level up the Sea Lord class to the max level?"

"You will need 6.555.329.921 coins," Merlin replied.

That class was the closest to reaching the max level compared to all the classes Ryan gained when he defeated dungeon masters. He had a feeling that the class would evolve as well. After all, those classes had a lot in common with the draconic ones. In any case, he will have to defeat another difficult opponent to obtain that many coins or at least another army of the size and as strong as the drake's army.

"I can't cheat on that, so maybe I will need mana to solve that problem" Ryan rubbed his chin thoughtfully.

Ryan had tons of loot that he gained in the battle of the previous day, and he also had a lot of essences to create mana potions. So, he will have to gather a lot of mana doing that. The problem was the time, Void World could solve that problem, but it will cost some extra mana.

"Oh, well Mana Control is leveling up pretty fast, and it will level up faster there, so it is not really a problem," Ryan shrugged and then entered his Void World.
