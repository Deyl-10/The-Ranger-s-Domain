Chapter 841: [Bonus Chapter]Doing great?

The next day, Femradiel returned to Cairo pretty early in the morning to prepare for the battle, but she didn't imagine that she would see the demon's army raising dust in the distance. Femradiel found Isis sitting at the border of the walls watching her followers moving to outside the walls alongside the monsters she created using the dungeon system.

"You are back," Isis said. "I have some bad news and good news for you."

"Tell me the bad news first," Femradiel said.

"The bad news is the fact that my other armies from the other dungeons that I had got attacked by demons," Isis said. "They were wiped out and they won't be able to help."

"And the good news?" Femradiel asked.

"Apparently, your friends in South America were giving a hard time to Mephisto, Alissa is also fighting Baal and his army. Beelzebub and Belial will try to attack from the East, so right now, only Lilith is leading that army of demons."

"I guess this is a pretty good opportunity for us," Femradiel nodded. "I was planning to deal with her sooner or later, so I guess I will fight her. You should conserve your strength to fight the Greek gods."

"Are you sure about that?" Isis asked. "We are going to ask a lot of you by summoning monsters already. Not to mention, our real goal here is to buy time for Loki to attack the Norse gods from behind."

"I won't take any risks, but I need to make sure that she won't be here once Ryan wakes up," Femradiel explained.

"Why? Is it because she can charm her enemies?" Isis frowned. "That is quite the silly worry that you have."

"She is an opponent that messed with Ryan's hand quite a bit when everything started, so I don't want to see him fighting her again," Femradiel added. "I have other reasons to fight her, but that is the main one."

"I see," Isis said.

"Well, I'd better start working," Femradiel said and then touched the Soul Trapper Stone.

After selecting a certain monster and editing their parameters a little bit, Femradiel finally felt confident about her chances. She could see with Clairvoyance and an army of corrupted fire golems, so it was a good chance to destroy all of them.

Femradiel nodded to herself in satisfaction, if she had the chance, she would make some more modifications, but she felt that it was enough for the time being. Without wasting any time, she summoned those in the middle of the enemies' golems. Even though she summoned dozens of them, they didn't last a single second. Such was the power of the demons and corrupted monsters. However, the golems exploded once they died, and the mana in their bodies froze everything around them. The following explosions made the frozen statues break, and even other monsters were frozen. The attacks caused a chain reaction, and in the blink of an eye, around 1500 monsters were defeated.

You obtained 645 coins.

"As expected, it would be too much to hope that I would recover as many coins as I used," Femradiel said. "Well, I have plenty of coins to spare."

The downside of that tactic was the fact that Femradiel didn't level up a single skill. On the other hand, she recovered some of the coins she spent, and she also recovered some mana that was quickly stored in her Soul Eater. Regardless, Femradiel repeated that action several times because the ice was slowing down the enemies even in the desert.

When a good part of the golems had been destroyed, Femradiel summoned Cold Whispers inside the enemies' army. A group of cyclops tried to smash them, but they hit the air. Without wasting time, the monsters cast a snowstorm, and hundreds of monsters were covered in snow. After that, Femradiel made the Cold Whispers return and summoned the Thunder Birds. From above, those creatures made lightning bolts that fell like rain on the battlefield. The droves killed the wet monsters, but soon enough, the Thunder Birds suffered from the same fate when some skeleton archers attacked them. Femradiel had customized them to have a high magic power but little to no health.

"That is what I get from trying to save coins" Femradiel said and then sighed.

"Don't worry, you are doing great," Isis said.

Femradiel wondered if that was true, after all. The army of demons and corrupted monsters numbered millions. Until now, Femradiel only killed a couple of thousands

Femradiel alternated between the types of monsters she was summoned, but when she could see the army of demons with her eyes alone, she didn't notice the enemies slowing down. The demons were attacking and overwhelming her summons with numbers alone. By the look of things, the demons weren't planning to use any strategy. They just wanted to crush them with brute strength.

"That isn't good" Femradiel said. "While they aren't approaching using any formation, they still will destroy us in a couple of minutes unless we create some holes in their front line."

"The only way of doing that is to summon sturdy monsters that will cause a lot of damage over time," Isis said.

Femradiel nodded It seemed a bit too soon for that, but Femradiel decided to use all the coins she obtained. After that, she would join the battle and kill as many monsters as possible to make Lilith appear.
