Chapter 831: Cerberus

Femradiel assumed that those Chimeras were like the others. Still, then she recalled that according to Isis, Echidna could create them as she saw fit when the Chimeras opened their mouths and used Fire Breath. A sea of fire flew toward the Ice Phoenix. Still, Femradiel made her fly upward as fast as possible before dashing downward toward the enemies. At first, the Ice Phoenix suffered quite a bit of damage. Still, when she got close enough, she killed dozens of chimers in a single instant after using Absolute Zero turning the creatures into ice sculptures that fell in the ground and shattered like glass.

Killing so many enemies made Femradiel receive a huge deal of mana. If only she had enough time, perhaps she would be able to defeat the enemies, steal their mana and then create the Tyrant familiar. Still, once again, she was reminded that things wouldn't proceed so favorably. The Ice Phoenix easily killed hundreds of Chimeras in a few instants. Still, then suddenly, a creature appeared out of nowhere and bit the Ice Phoenix's neck. Femradiel clicked her tongue in annoyance when the creature fell on the ground and then snapped the neck of the Ice Phoenix.

"That is" Femradiel frowned.

Ryan had mentioned that he almost got killed by one of the underlings of Echidna. Cerberus was back and was way stronger than Ryan had depicted him. It was only obvious, though Still, considering Echidna's power, he seemed way stronger than one was supposed to be able to summon.

While Femradiel was thinking about that, the Ice Phoenix was revived and used Absolute Zero again. That made Cerberus drop her body, but instead of making her run away, Femradiel made her fly and face the Chimeras. At the same time, Femradiel teleported to where Cerberus was.

"Who are you, woman?" Cerberus asked.

Femradiel ignored the question and summoned Drake to face the Scyllas that were approaching in the distance. Once that happened, she bombarded Cerberus with Ruby Arrows. It wasn't her style to use that kind of skill, but ice magic that was her forte wouldn't let her kill Cerberus as fast as she wanted.

Cerberus grunted in annoyance when he saw his health being sealed. Still, instead of retreating, he charged toward Femradiel like a lightning bolt. Once that happened, Femradiel used her arms to stop Cerberus' mouth and keep it wide open. While she was being pushed backward because of the momentum, she summoned a copy of Thunder Lord Crossbow. She then fired numerous bolts inside his mouth.

Cerberus was caught off guard, but before he could receive any real damage, he made several massive blocks of ice fall. Femradiel created some distance between them with a single jump, but she didn't stop attacking Cerberus with Ruby Arrows.

Cerberus opened his mouth and used Fire Breath to destroy the arrow. Still, the very moment he did that, Femradiel teleported to the right above him and fell on his back. Femradiel grabbed his back in order not to fall while she kept firing Ruby Arrows. However, she didn't imagine that Cerberus would make some massive ice blocks fall over himself just to hit her. Femradiel jumped once again to escape the attack but frowned when the blocks of ice shattered into pieces as soon as they touched Cerberus.

As if Cerberus wanted to avoid dealing with Femradiel on his back again, Cerberus summoned several Fire Spears and made them fly around himself.

"What a troublesome monster he is not only physically and magically stronger, but he can also think fast," Femradiel furrowed her eyebrows.

Cerberus attacked again, but this time he fired some Fireballs that could explode even before they touched anything. Femradiel was forced to jump backward several times to escape all the damage she couldn't afford to get wounded against one of Echidna's dog. She was lucky that Echidna didn't decide to join the fight since it was obvious who the invader's real target was. Still, Femradiel had to find a way to finish that as soon as possible.

Femradiel had a certain idea, but it mainly relied on ice magic. Considering that Cerberus had high resistance against it, she imagined that it would be useless, but she didn't have any other choice but to try. When Cerberus dashed again, Femradiel jumped backward even though just teleporting would be faster, but that had been a part of her plan to attack the mythological beast. Suddenly, when Cerberus passed right above the place Femradiel had been half a second ago, a massive spike of ice rose from the ground and touched Cerberus and then trapped him in a prison of ice. Soon enough, the ice cracked, but before he could move again, several Ice Meteors fell from the sky and hit him. Putting the ice damage aside, the impact surely would cause some. However, Femradiel was only left with disappointment when the attack stopped, and she saw Cerberus, completely unscathed.

"Dear me" Femradiel said and then sighed.

Cerberus bombarded Femradiel with Fire Spears while he made sure to zigzag around and dodge from her Ruby Arrows. Femradiel couldn't help but clench her teeth in annoyance. The beast had massive health, but its speed was also a problem Fortunately, she had brought Ryan's entire collection of crossbows
