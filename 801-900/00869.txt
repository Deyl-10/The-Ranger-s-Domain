Chapter 870: Vs. Odin and Baldr

"Impressive. I thought you were supposed to be a bowman, but to think that you would survive a direct attack like that" A white-haired man floating in the air said.

When Ryan looked above, he saw a white-haired man that had an eye patch over his right eye. He also had a long white beard, but despite having the features of an old man, he had the body of someone in his prime. Aside from that, Odin had his legendary spear on his right hand. He also was a golden armor that protected him completely down to his knees. On his head, Ryan could see one of those famous horned helmets.

On his right side, Ryan also found a light-brown-haired man wearing only some pants and light silver armor. Loki had described him as a pretty violent man, but Ryan couldn't see any signs of that while looking at the calm posture on the side of Odin. In any case, even though Odin looked really dignified, Baldr looked wilder, at least when it comes to his hair and gruff beard. Not to mention his eyes, he had the eyes of one of those berserker warriors of stories...

"Tell me, are you the human called Ryan?" Odin asked. "The same who defeated Poseidon?"

"I guess so" Ryan said and then pointed his magic crossbows to the sides and attacked the Drakes who wanted to pass him.

"My apologies, you came here to stop our attack, am I correct?" Odin asked. "I will stop my army advance for a short while. Until I kill you."

"I am thankful for your consideration," Ryan smiled. Still, then the smile disappeared from his face when he saw Baldr disappearing."

Ryan used Teleport and barely escaped being punched by Baldr. However, he could see how powerful that punch had been Baldr hit only the air, but the movement alone made the entire area around him vibrate. His punch even made the wind in front of him forcefully move forward, creating a path of destruction that was several hundred meters long. The power of that physical attack was surreal... Ryan couldn't let himself being hit by those in a row. Otherwise...

"Father, let me kill this insolent worm who showed a mocking smile after hearing your words," Baldr said.

"We shouldn't underestimate him, Baldr," Odin said. "He already defeated Poseidon alone, and he can dodge your attacks at least some of them. He isn't a target that we should underestimate. Not to mention, we came here with a goal, and he isn't part of that goal. You might find this unsightly, but we need to be careful for the sake of our people and history. Not to mention, we don't know who he is working with or how he managed to obtain divine energy, so we can't take any chances."

After hearing that, Ryan couldn't help but force a smile and sweat cold. Deep down, he had hoped that those two would use some bullshit logic like chivalry or another code of honor to fight him one-on-one. That certainly would be good for him, but the reality is often disappointing

Ryan suddenly felt a shiver, and Death Sense warned him. However, once again, he was unable to do anything. Another lightning bolt fell and hit him. While Ryan was feeling his body being burned by the electric discharge. Baldr suddenly appeared and then punched Ryan in the stomach. His body bent forward, and then he was sent flying in the distance. That combo sure was annoying...

Ryan felt his whole body like it was falling apart. Bones, bloody vessels had ruptured with a single punch. Loki wasn't joking when he said that Baldr's attacks could ignore defense. Regardless, Ryan used Full-Heal even before he stopped flying. In the end, he stopped after his body hit a mountain and reached half of the middle waypoint. He was forced to heal himself again, and then he felt the danger for his life.

This time, Ryan managed to use Draconic Transformation and Mana Barrier. However, he still got hit by another lightning bolt that paralyzed half of his body. He wondered how that was possible he thought that only special attacks could ignore defensive spells, but it seemed that Odin could do what with all his attacks. Ryan waited to be punched, but he only found Baldr on Odin's side again, studying Ryan with serious eyes.

"He really can transform into an ice dragon, and with that much energy it seems it is true that he defeated Poseidon," Baldr said. "Still, something feels off...

While Baldr was amused, Ryan decided to attack. He summoned Vengeful Sea Crossbow and aimed at Odin's single eye. Those lightning bolts of his were that annoying, after all. Ryan pulled the trigger even when Odin made another lightning bolt fall on his head. Still, much to his surprise, he noticed that the water bolts didn't move an inch, even when they appeared a few millimeters away from Odin's face.

"I believe those are yours," Odin said and then fired back the water bolts.

As if it was only natural, the water bolts pierced the Mana Barrier. They hit Ryan's face even his own attacks could completely ignore the Mana Barrier how? After thinking for a while, Ryan understood that it was thanks to the spear on Odin's hand. According to the myths of Norse Mythology, Gungnir never misses a target and, when it is thrown, always returns to Odin what if he had managed to extend that effect to his magic? If that was the case, Ryan knew that he was in a pretty bad spot.
