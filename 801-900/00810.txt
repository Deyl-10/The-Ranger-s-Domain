Chapter 811: Disperse

Chapter 811: Disperse

Once they grew tired of breaking ceilings, Ryan, Femradiel, and Alissa decided to stop to catch a breath. Naturally, Hypnos annoyed the hell out of them with his attacks. Considering what happened before, Ryan assumed that Hypnos was somewhere above them. However, they could only cause so much destruction. Hypnos made sure to create an environment in his dream world where he could attack and be protected by hundreds of layers of earth. If anything, he deserved praise for being that creative.

"We don't have enough power to keep going like this," Femradiel said. "For all we know, it is possible that Hypnos is creating another layer of defense right now between us and him. In this place his will is absolute."

"We have wasted too much time here, we have to return to reality right now, no matter the cost," Alissa nodded.

Hearing those two talking like that made Ryan realize that he couldn't pull his punches anymore. Hypnos was powerful and too skilled, so they had to force him to fight seriously in order to make him stop with that crap about changing the place for the better.

"Let's do that, then," Ryan said. "It should be enough to let us escape from his hellhole."

Hypnos didn't know what they were talking about since they didn't show any skill in that world that could make them escape the dark cave. While Hypnos could use Absolute Appraisal, he couldn't find certain skills due to their ability to hide skills. Regardless, Ryan, Femradiel, and Alissa raise their heads, and then in the next moment, they used Draconic Bow.

Even the natural darkness of the place was unable to completely make it disappear the light emanated by all mana of those three. Still, that was the minor of the Hypnos problems. The massive cannon of energy fired by them pierced the layers of the cave and completely destroyed it like it was made of cotton. After destroying hundreds of those layers, Ryan, Femradiel, and Alissa finally could see the sky of that world but something was off.

"Where are we" Femradiel asked.

The world seemed different from the previous one, but it didn't seem like that was the case since Ryan and the others still could see the score. Above them, they found a completely dark and starless sky. Around them, they saw what seemed to be a massive mountain range of mountains covered in darkness Those mountains were as big as Hypnos castle. So, it wasn't surprising that they had to use their Draconic Arrows to open the path to the exit. Regardless, they raised their guard since their mana was low, and they didn't know that place. However, much to their surprise, Hypnos didn't attack them.

"Keep your eyes open and your senses sharp," Ryan said. "He won't take us lightly after we showed that attack."

Ryan assumed that Hypnos didn't attack because he was cautious. It was only natural that he would do so since their combined attacks would certainly damage him quite a lot.

After a while, those three couldn't help but frown. Hypnos was nowhere to be seen, and he wasn't attacking either. That was beyond weird while he didn't seem much of a warrior, he certainly didn't look like a coward that would run away from the enemy that had his brother under custody.

"Well, let's use this opportunity to recover our energy," Ryan said.

They couldn't throw away such an opportunity, even more so considering that Hypnos had no idea how much energy they spent. Ryan wanted to use some potions that could increase his attributes as well, but since those only lasted for five minutes, it wasn't wise to use them when Hypnos was nowhere to be seen.

After a while, Hypnos suddenly appeared, and this time he looked different. He was wearing full plate white armor that made him look angelic-like. As if that wasn't enough, he also had a headband made of some sort of plant and a silver bow on his hands.

"So, he is a magic archer," Ryan said.

"My apologies for taking my time in preparing for the battle," Hypnos said. "Still, I figured that in the end, I will have to face all of you seriously."

Ryan couldn't help but be a bit surprised. After all, Thanatos lost against Ryan and Femradiel, and now they had the help of another human being who had Draconic powers and, most likely, was stronger than Ryan. Despite that, he still wanted to face those three at the same time

"Better late than never," Ryan said.

As soon as Ryan said that, Hypnos pointed his bow toward him, and much to his surprise, he didn't even shoot an arrow, but Ryan felt something piercing his chest.

"What" Ryan said.

Alissa and Femradiel bombarded the enemy while Ryan was recovering from the surprise. Still, Hypnos just pointed his bow at the ice spears, and the breath and that had been enough to make those dissipate. It looked like he could use some extremely high-level version of Disrupt Magic.

Ryan decided to join the fray, but then he noticed that the area around where he got supposedly hit had gone numb. That was another type of magic that he had never seen before.

"Use the Mana Barrier! Don't let him hit you!" Ryan shouted.

"I wonder if that will be enough," Hypnos said.

Ryan and Femradiel noticed it. Hypnos was Thanatos's brother. It wouldn't be weird if he actually could damage or hit others with his special arrows while ignoring their defensive spells. Just like Thanatos, the only way to deal with that kind of attack was by forcing Hypnos to lose sight of them.

After using Purification for a while, Ryan managed to feel that area of his torso again. Still, it was only because Alissa and Femradiel kept him busy. If anyone got hit multiple times by the arrows of that bow, things would get very messy. Using all her power, Femradiel created a mist to cover the entire region. Still, in the end, Hypnos easily dispersed the spell.
