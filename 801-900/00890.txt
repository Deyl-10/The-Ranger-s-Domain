Chapter 891: No Thanks

Chapter 891: No thanks

"Let's not be hasty, Thor," Zeus said while looking at Ryan. "We need to show some respect toward the man who defeated Poseidon and Odin."

"Says the man who greeted me by using hundreds of Electric Spears," Ryan furrowed his eyebrows.

"My apologies, but I needed to check that you didn't defeat those two by pure luck," Zeus said, still looking at Ryan as if he was trying to kill him with his eyes alone. "Before anything, I would like to ask where you put their spirits."

"In a place you will never reach," Ryan replied with a smile on his face.

"While you throw mud in our names, I still need to thank you for not killing them," Zeus said. "That would be unforgivable and I would make sure to make the entire human race for that crime."

"Well aren't you quite merciful?" Ryan frowned. "Let's make the humans pay for the 'crime' one. The crime you speak of, was just me fighting and defeating in a one-on-one fight against someone who wanted to drown the entire world. Odin was the same, he wanted the same justice you speak, but in the end, he failed at achieving his goal."

Thor swung his hammer, and the most giant lightning bolt fell on Ryan's head instantly. The attack made Ryan tremble from head to toe while he felt that even his bones were turning into charcoal. That was quite worrisome, considering that Electric Aura was already on, and Ryan didn't feel any relief from those attacks.

Congratulations! The skill Electric Aura has levelled up.

"It is King Odin, worm," Thor glared at Ryan. "You will show respect, or you will pay dearly."

Ryan wished that he could say something sarcastic, but after the attack, he had to wait for a while before his mind could work properly. Maybe Merlin's predictions weren't off the mark even if Electric Aura reaches the max level, Ryan was having a hard time thinking that it would be enough.

"Whatever, dude," Ryan said and then shook his head to regain the focus in his eyes. "You sure are different from your father. You could learn how to keep your cool from him, but if you didn't learn until now, then you won't ever learn."

Thor raised his hammer again, but this time Ryan reacted on time to dodge by teleporting. The massive lightning bolt fell on the trolls' army and decimated hundreds of them. In contrast, the sound alone paralyzed many others. Ryan had assumed that Thor would be a plain warrior that could use lightning alongside his hammer, but it seemed that he wasn't so bad at magic.

"I already told both of you to calm down," Zeus glared at them both. "If you kill him, you fool, you won't recover your father's spirit. Who knows for how long we will have to wait for him to free himself from that prison."

Thor snorted. As expected, he wasn't the type who would look at things with a calm mind. While it was only natural, his attitude would cause more problems to his people down the line.Â  In any case, Ryan couldn't help but wonder wouldn't it be better if Odin never came? Or was he that worried about the spirit of Poseidon?

"Let's make a deal, the winner of this battle will gain everything," Zeus said. "Our spirits, our abilities, our weapons Naturally, we will fight one-on-one. You have the world of the god of the gods that we will keep our end of the bargain as long as you keep the weapons which you sealed the spirits of the elder gods in a place where we can reach."

"Thanks, but no thanks," Ryan said.

Zeus let out a sigh. It was OK to be dubious of that offer, but to refuse it without giving any thought? Zeus assumed that Ryan had planned to make them go easy on him in order for them not to lose the spirits of the elder gods, but in fact, that was something Ryan thought about just now.

" Since things have come down to this, then I don't have any other choice," Zeus said after a long sigh. "We will crush again and again, until not a single piece of your spirit will be found inside this shell of yours. Prepare to become nothing but a dog."

Zeus pointed his right hand toward Ryan, and then dozens of his bolts fell from the sky. Ryan didn't even have the time to see a single one of them. Such was their speed. That being said, he managed to use Teleport and then retreat, and the bolts only hit the trolls. However, Ryan suddenly felt an impact on his right side and then felt his bones cracking. The pain spread around his whole body while Thor's attack made him spin in toward the opposite direction. Ryan really hates combined attacks

As if things weren't troublesome enough, Zeus bombarded Ryan even before he could stop flying with his bolts. Once again, Ryan felt like Electric Aura was completely useless However, when he felt Thor approaching again, he clenched his teeth and recovered for a second. He had enough time to summon the crossbow in which he sealed Odin, and that surprised Thor. Without hesitation, Ryan bombarded him with Dark Bolts.

Thor protects himself with the hammer. While he didn't suffer much damage, his already massive hammer became even heavier, which made him frown. Ryan had planned to keep attacking with Fire Bolts, but Zeus stopped him with another huge torrent of his bolts. Before he could try to take the weapon, Ryan stored it away.
