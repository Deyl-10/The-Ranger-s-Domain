Chapter 890: Vs. Thor and Zeus

Although Femradiel's plan was just a slight upgrade from Ryan's, he didn't complain. Still, he felt slightly troubled in having to fight while considering that Loki would have to back him up. Before leaving, Femradiel and Ryan gave the orders for their pets to fight to protect Egypt no matter what. In the last moment as well, Ryan decided to do something unusual to pump him and Femradiel. A brofist it seemed silly, but it was the best Ryan could do at the moment to show his trust on her.

"What is this?" Femradiel frowned.

"Just close your hand and touch it," Ryan said. "It is like a promise between friends, friends friends..... That we will win no matter what."

"Why did you tried to imitate an echo in the word friends?" Femradiel frowned even more. "Well, I suppose this is just like you too damn shy."

After touching each other's fists, Ryan and Feramdiel teleported. In North of Spain, Ryan found an army of king trolls marching toward Loki's domain. While Ryan could also see, thanks to Clairvoyance, an army of Fenrir in front of his domain. They didn't seem like the best match-up against the trolls.

"I heard details from Isis, are you sure about this?" Loki asked.

"Yes, I am," Ryan replied. "Coming here will help me achieve my goal with more ease just make sure to let those two fight me, you can deal with anyone else, all right?"

"Those two?" Loki frowned.

Ryan used Draconic Transformation and then dashed toward the trolls. In the end, instead of attacking with arrows and bolts, he just summoned Draconic Sword and then began to swing it around wildly. The king trolls tried to attack Ryan with their ice clubs. They were ten meters long, after all. However, they were too slow

Since the enemies were numerous, Ryan didn't even have to worry about missing or being skillful. He just swung his sword around, and monsters and their weapons were split in half as if they were made of butter. Eventually, some of them began to fire Ice Spear toward him, but what was the point of firing Ice Spears against an ice dragon?

For a second, Ryan even considered summoning Soul Eater and then fill it with some of the enemies' mana. Still, he did well in not doing that Suddenly, several Electric Spears fell from the sky at absurd speeds, and Ryan didn't even have time to dodge them. He got hit and paralyzed which surprised him since, at some point, he even got used to Odin's lightning bolts, but even though those spears were a lot smaller, they caused more damage.

While Ryan was being attacked by a rain of continuous Electric Spears, the king trolls passed by him as if it was only natural. Their goal really was Loki's domain Somehow, Ryan activated Electric Aura, and then the pain and the paralysis decreased. Thanks to that, Ryan had the chance to use Teleport and escape from the torrent of attacks. Once he did that, he felt two presences floating in the air.

The visitors that Ryan had been waiting for finally showed up It was weird, but Zeus was pretty similar to how Ryan had imagined him. He was an old man that had one heck of a physique despite having long white hair and beard. His eyes emitted a silver-ish glow, but from them, Ryan could see sparks emanating. How strong someone had to be to be able to emanate sparks of energy in their eyes? Zeus didn't have a weapon or armor. Instead of that, he was just wearing half of a robe on his upper body and showing off his muscles. Despite that, Ryan knew that he was far from being defenseless.

On the other hand, Thor was completely armed and armored from head to toe. He was a tall, young-looking man who had red hair and a beard. Both of those were quite gruff. On his left hand, one could see the legendary hammer, Mjolnir. Aside from that, his armor and helmet seemed pretty normal. Still, his brown eyes were weird aside from the usual transparent glow that showed that he had a high level of divinity, his eyes were so brown that they kind of looked red like blood.

"Oh, boy you were waiting for those two?" Loki said via Telepathy. "I commend you, Ryan. You have balls or perhaps you just have a death wish."

"No shit, Sherlock," Ryan said while sweating cold.

Congratulations! The skill Fear Resistance has leveled up.

Ryan knew that those two would emit one hell of bloodlust, but even in his guess, he had underestimated them somehow. Their bloodlust was so intense that Ryan felt like his body was being pierced by one thousand needles one thousand very sharp but thick needles.

The afternoon sky was quite blue in that part of the country and of the year, but dark clouds appeared alongside those two. There was no mistake they would be the most challenging enemies Ryan would have to defeat.

"Human release my father's spirit, and I will grant you a quick death," Thor said with his chin up.

"Bearded man, make me do it," Ryan said. "You can also try asking nicely, it may work."

Thor raised his hammer, but then Zeus moved his right arm to stop him. That was more like it. Before any battle, those types of beings had to waste some time with chit-chat. That was how things were supposed to be.
