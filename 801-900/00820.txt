Chapter 821: State of the world

"The next time she comes, I should ask her to create a sun here," Ryan said. "Then, I will be able to think more freely while looking at the sunset."

Ryan had planned to train most of his skills to learn the ins and outs while they level up, but in the end, time was limited. So, he couldn't just choose randomly, he had to choose the ones that could be useful in all battles, and he was having a hard time thanks to it.

"What do you think, buddy?" Ryan asked Furball. "Should I train the skills I have or focus on leveling up new classes and getting new special classes? Raise your left paw for the first option and the right for the second."

Weirdly enough, Furball raised the right paw without hesitation. Perhaps he was more intelligent than Ryan thought After checking the list of classes, Ryan saw that he had only a couple of classes that were anywhere close to reaching the max level, but that is something that always happens. Then he would ignore them for a while, and then suddenly, they would level up like crazy in the middle of a difficult battle.

"All right, I am bored, and I don't know what to train, so you are going to help me here," Ryan said and then used Skill Bestowal on Furball. "Now, attack me with the elemental spells."

Ryan wished that he could use Gravity magic, but he couldn't. Now that he thought about it, he could manipulate darkness and shadows, but there were no shadows to manipulate since they were in the middle of a tropical island that doesn't know the night.

Congratulations! The skill Fire Resistance has leveled up.

Congratulations! The skill Cold Resistance has leveled up.

Congratulations! The skill Electric Resistance has leveled up.

While Ryan was making himself more resilient against elemental attacks, Femradiel was doing some reconnaissance work for Isis. She was pretty good at sensing others, and she was pretty good at hiding from others as well. So, she was perfect for that kind of job. Not to mention, she had the same skills as Rya, so she could see pretty much everything in outer space without being noticed.

Right at that moment, Femradiel wasn't much further away from Egypt. She was pretty close to checking things in Europe. Things were getting pretty tense there since, thanks to Hypnos, the elder gods last their path to the pendragons' world, and even though those who knew where they could find the mithril were creating new dungeons there, it would take a while for that to bore any fruit.

"What a mess" Femradiel said.

Basically, every single dungeon in Europe had dozens of thousands of monsters behind, and all of them were working to an elder god. They offered some prizes to the dungeon masters to join their sides. Thanks to that, the Greek gods were obtaining a lot of power, but the Norse gods weren't staying behind in the North. While Loki obtained a domain and he was a pain in their asses, the Norse gods, probably still the largest armies since few humans got on their path.

As soon as she obtained intel regarding the types of monsters and the numbers each side has, Femradiel returned to Egypt, and she was informed that Isis was waiting for her in her Oasis. That was weird since she didn't leave Egypt in the last few days since Hypnos caused trouble, but Femradiel soon realized why she was there, and when Femradiel arrived, she confirmed her assumptions. Athena and Loki were with her.

"Are you alone today, little miss dragon?" Loki asked.

"Bite me," Femradiel said.

"It seems someone is on edge for some reason," Loki shrugged while smiling.

"Why did you tell him?" Femradiel asked while looking at Isis.

"He would discover sooner or later about Ryan," Isis said. "Instead of letting him cause trouble to gather intel, we saved ourselves from the hassle. So, can you share with us what you learned today?"

The elder gods couldn't leave their domains or use magic that often now that all the others were around. Even if Isis, Athena, and Loki were to use Clairvoyance, they would leave traces for the other elder gods, and that would make them look suspicious.

After Femradiel shared the information with them, Athena began to tap on the round table in front of them. She looked even more serious than usual probably because a massive fight was about to break out, and the world would be the one who would suffer the most damage.

"It seems we can divide the globe into five parts now," Isis said and then created a hologram-like map with magic. "The demons have taken over half of Africa already, and they are quickly marching North. They are also moving their armies to wipe out all humans from America and the Northern parts of Asia. The people in Russia and America might resist for a while, but things won't go well if the demon generals join the fight."

Femradiel realized that perhaps Isis had planned that meeting to happen and keep it as a secret from Ryan. Knowing him, he wouldn't let the demons take over the American continent. Even if he had to face all the remaining five by himself, he would fight them until his last breath. He would die trying because he was the type who wouldn't last, demons defile the lands he came from.

"Most parts of Asia are under the control of Indians or the Chinese since they are strong and have many guardians and fallen heroes on their sides, neither demons nor the elder gods will try to attack them for the time being. However, they are bound to move if a fight breaks out around our territories. They know that the victor may become the most troublesome enemy, after all. In the end, things will start here the Mediterranean."
