Chapter 871: Counter

Congratulations! Your Electric Resistance has leveled up.

Congratulations! Your Shock Resistance has leveled up.

In the end, Ryan deactivates Mana Barrier and just decided to accept the attacks. He also tried to dodge them by teleporting, but not even that worked after getting by twelve lightning bolts in a row. Ryan accepted that he couldn't dodge a single one of them. So, he just clenched his teeth and summoned his magic bows.

When Baldr tried to attack him once again, Ryan pointed his weapons toward him. Baldr wasn't much faster than Ryan in his draconic form, so he could follow him with his eyes. However, when he prepared to bombard him. Several lightning bolts fell over Ryan's head at the same time. Once again, he was completely paralyzed, and once again, Baldr had the chance to attack him without worrying about anything.

This time, his massive body wasn't sent flying for dozens of kilometers. Still, the pain of a single punch had been so concentrated that Ryan spat a mouthful of blood after being pushed backward for several meters.

Ryan glared murderously at Odin, but the king of gods of the Norse mythology didn't feel anything when he met those eyes. As expected of a true master of magic, he only needed to think of a single moment, and he could fire several lightning bolts. If it weren't for Conversion and Spell Reading, Ryan would have been killed a long time ago.

Odin proved that he wouldn't be hit by elemental attacks, not even if they were fired at point-blank range. So, Ryan decided to test something else He knew that Odin would try to prevent his attacks. With that in mind, he aimed at Baldr but then summoned his Hydra's Bow and fired toward Odin. Not even the pain of being hit by several lightning bolts prevented him from doing that. However, Odin easily blocked the projectile with his spear. In fact, he Ryan hadn't been throw around thanks to Baldr's punches, Odin wouldn't have moved from his spot.

"Merlin" Ryan said. "Give me a list of the classes that can boost my resistance to electric attacks."

"Understood," Merlin said.

Ryan assumed a defensive position to protect his vitals. At the same time, that it didn't help much since Baldr's punches could make his entire being tremble. He didn't have to do that for long.

While Ryan tried to be subtle, he noticed that Odin frowned and stopped attacking for a short while. It seemed that he had noticed it it was weird, though. He never tried to attack Merlin.

"Merlin, can other people see you?" Ryan whispered.

"Not in battle, I can make myself invisible and intangible," Merlin thinks of me as a part of your soul that can't be touched unless you die."

That only made things weirder, but it didn't matter. Ryan lost three million points in mana to obtain that class and paid five million more mana points to make the skill reach level fifty. It was quite the investment, but it was necessary since Ryan barely had the chance to attack the enemies until now.

"Baldr let's finish him off with the next attack," Odin said. "He has some sort of power that grants the ability to obtain abilities and make them level up on the fly. We can't afford to let him grow even stronger like this."

Ryan clicked his tongue in annoyance. Even though Odin only had a single eye, his only eye was pretty good. Ryan couldn't let them prepare a big attack, so he teleported to right in front of Odin and used Draconic Bow.

This time, Ryan was certain that Odin didn't have the chance to easily repel the attack. A massive explosion happened that even surprised Ryan and made him fly for several kilometers backward. That was weird, though. He didn't get that much stronger while he was training he only got a bit sturdier. Regardless, the power of his skill alone made the entire area tremble. The skill, the ground, the air For a second, Ryan thought that Odin was the one attacking to cause such an event.

After a couple of seconds, Ryan saw some cracks in the ground around and a crater right below Odin was supposed to be. That crater was weird, though only half of it could be seen. It was almost like the attack had been blocked by Odin, and he protected his army. When the dust began to disperse, Ryan finally saw what happened Baldr had used his body to protect Odin.

"Holy crap" Ryan frowned when he looked at Baldr.

Baldr's body was pretty messed up after getting hit directly. He has lost his two legs and his left arm. Most of the skin of his body had been burned as well. Despite that, his body was healing so fast that Ryan couldn't believe his eyes. He had to finish him off, but then twenty lightning bolts fell one after the other on his back. This time, even though he had got studier, even though he was in his draconic form, even though he obtained Electric Immunity Ryan was forced to bend the knee in order not to fall before the king of the Norse Gods.
