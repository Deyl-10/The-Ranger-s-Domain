After clearing some dungeons, Femradiel finally obtained a pretty good class. Leveling up easily in some classes was always good, but in the end, few things could be compared to the feeling of obtaining a new class.

Femradiel's army of monsters brainwashed thanks to the power of Lust was increasing by the minute, so she couldn't help but worry about when the enemies were going to show up. That kind of army really made her feel uncomfortable, after all. Fortunately, it looked like the wait was over. Femradiel suddenly felt two presences appearing nearby, and they seemed pretty powerful. She tried to keep doing her own things in order to fool them, but that only gave a chance for the enemies to attack her.

A beam of light fell from the skies and then hit the area where Femradiel was. The temperature didn't increase suddenly. It immediately burned everything around Femradiel. Thanks to Death Sense, Femradiel used Teleport and escaped on time, but she couldn't help but look at the massive hole in the ground left by the attack It was quite impressive that a beam of light alone managed to do that.

It seemed that Isis's stealth skills were really something else. To think that only two Greek gods would come, and one of them was a minor deity like Helios. In theory, that was the best outcome, but considering Helios' previous attack, Femradiel knew that theory wasn't everything.

Helios was a blond young-looking man wearing light silver armor. Weirdly enough, he didn't have any weapon with him, but he had a chariot that wasn't being pulled by anything. Despite that, he looked pretty serious about the fight or the fact that the enemy was Femradiel.

As for Aphrodite, even Femradiel couldn't help but gulp while looking at her. It wasn't weird, but it seemed that her charm powers were highly effective even against females, even though Femradiel trained her charm resistance like crazy. Or maybe it wasn't due to her powers, but her real appearance. Aphrodite was a redhead beauty that had emerald-like green eyes. She had a pretty curvy body and lustrous lips, but the little fat she had was in the right places. Looking at her massive chest and very thin robe, Femradiel already could feel her shoulders getting sore.

"As expected, Ryan shouldn't really fight that" Femradiel thought. "It is too dangerous in many ways..."

As much as he tried to deny it, Ryan had an attraction to redheads. They made an even more troublesome combination when they had green eyes; it was almost his Achilles' heel. Regardless, before anyone could make any move, Aphrodite stared at Femradiel as if she were her archenemy. Femradiel couldn't remember doing anything against her aside from laying that trap. Still, she wasn't that much worried about stares.

Suddenly, Isis finally reappeared and then grabbed Helios by the neck, and she teleported both of them to somewhere else. While that happened, Aphrodite didn't even blink it almost looked like she had been waiting for that.

"Give me that bow that has the spirit of Lilith, and I swear it that I won't do anything against you, dragon woman," Aphrodite said. "I won't take a no for an answer."

Aphrodite's voice was quite beautiful and sweet. Even though she was angry, one couldn't feel that threatened while listening to her angry voice. Naturally, Femradiel just ignored and tried to analyze Aphrodite with her eyes this time. However, she couldn't find any trace of a warrior on her, not even the presence of a mage or of an archer. That was quite weird, but that didn't surprise Femradiel.

"Here is my counteroffer: leave the planet and swear not to return, and I might give you the bow," Femradiel said. "No, wait... you have to ask nicely too."

Aphrodite slowly clapped her hands, and Femradiel summoned the crossbow that increases her intelligence for a time when she hits the enemy. Without holding back, she pulled the trigger, but as soon as Aphrodite closed her eyes, the bolt stopped midair, ten meters away from her.

"This is going to be a pain in the ass" Femradiel thought when she realized that Aphrodite didn't use any skills or mana to block her attack.

Regardless, Femradiel still had some ideas she needed to test before doing anything. Hopefully, that won't put her on a difficult spot...
