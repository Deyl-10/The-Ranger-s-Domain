Chapter 754: Mythological Zombie Warrior

Although the trip was long, it wasn't like Ryan and Femradiel didn't do anything aside from teleporting from one place to another. They also made some preparations for some situations and also began to use the mithril. Patience was the key in order to get better at forging weapons, so Ryan made sure to use the same amount of mithril several times.

He made a bow without a string and then melted. Ryan repeated that process dozens of times since he didn't have to worry about its durability. According to Nakine, as long as a weapon made of mithril isn't enchanted with a spirit, it could be reforged as many times as one might want.

"Why are you trying to craft a bow?" Femradiel asked.

"Bows grant more dexterity, so their raw power is better," Ryan replied. "I don't know when we are going to obtain any mithril again, so we should exponentialize what we have."

Ryan was thinking of making a bow which he could use on his Draconic form. At the same time, he also wanted a full set of armor to use while Draconic Transformation stays active. Still, it would take a while before he reaches that level.

Suddenly, Ryan stopped when he used Clairvoyance to check the path ahead. For a second, he thought his eyes were fooling him because he could see the sky, but he couldn't see the ground. After adjusting his vision, Ryan confirmed that he found the place where Alissa fought. Still, things were much crazier than he had imagined The hole was like five kilometers wide and three deep.

"Did you guys know where the nearest dungeons are?" Ryan asked.

"Two days on our speed, West of here," Nakine replied.

"In the same direction? Come to think of it, it is weird that two dungeon masters would work together" Ryan said. "Unless"

"That is right, their dungeons are close to each other and they have been working together since their dungeons appeared," Nakine nodded.

"Femradiel," Ryan said.

"I can feel the dungeons and one single massive army in that direction," Femradiel said. "However, I don't feel any presence nearby."

That was only natural. They looked for Alissa for almost one week. They didn't find anything, so they gave up without finding her body. In any case, it was time to move carefully since it wouldn't be weird if the dungeon masters now and then check that massive hole.

During that week, Ryan also taught the dragons Shapeshifting, so they quickly turned into Reptilians. It was the best they could do right now, and it was more than enough since their size decreased drastically.

"I don't feel any traces of Alissa's mana," Femradiel said. "Most likely, the explosion made all traces in the area spread in all directions. We won't be able to rely on traces of mana to find her."

"I figured as much looking for her will be a waste of time," Ryan said. "Perhaps we should let her find us."

"I wonder if she will come once she realizes that we are here," Femradiel furrowed her eyebrows. "Considering her mind condition and the level of corruption she was supposed to have already, she probably tried to help the dragons here not because of a sense of duty."

Ryan could understand that, but in the end, her ultimate goal was obvious, find a way to restore Orgar's conscience. If Ryan becomes an ally of the dragons in that world, she will eventually approach them hopefully sooner than later.

"Let's check the enemies in the West," Ryan said.

After heading in that direction for several hours, the group finally got close enough to find the dungeon with the help of Clairvoyance. Alongside with it, they found a massive army of humanoid creatures that seemed like humans armed with shields and spears and other species that also looked humanoid. Still, they had pickaxes instead of real weapons.

After taking a good look at those monsters, Ryan concluded that the first group was the real main force, and the second was only there to offer support and to look for mithril. Around that area, there were countless holes and abandoned mines. A good look at them made Ryan realize that those creatures perhaps once had been humans, but now they were almost zombies who had only a single goal in mind.

Regardless, what was really bothering Ryan was the question of who were the dungeon masters controlling those creatures. Ryan had a few ideas, but a single one stood out among the others, but it seemed too ridiculous from his perspective.

"That doesn't change anything we have to wipe out that army and then catch the dungeon masters off guard and when they are alone," Ryan concluded.
