Chapter 741: That Bad

Chapter 741: That bad

"I guess it can't be helped" Ryan sighed and then scratched the back of his head.

Ryan lost his domain and his army of monsters, so he will have to obtain a lot more to recover the place. After all, he didn't truly lose it. Only after someone kills him might they obtain ownership of the place. Still, now that barrier was gone, ten or so dungeon masters were free to level up their monsters in America. Ryan has to return with more resources as fast as possible to wipe those creatures out of Earth.

"Tell us what you know about the situation of this world," Femradiel said. "We will be able to help more once we have a good grasp of things here."

"Certainly but if you don't mind, can I ask you something?" Nelron asked.

"Yes, I am a dragon," Femradiel said. "That is what you were about to ask, right? Anyway, I am not for your species probably."

"I can understand that I can feel a soul much more powerful than the dragons of this planet on your body," Nelron said. "Still, you seem a bit different, not because of that. The fact that you didn't know about us is weird as well."

"Well, my life story is long, we don't have enough time for that," Femradiel said. "Let's focus on saving your friends."

Nelron began to explain what he knew about the terrain in that world. Since he had been alive only for three hundred years. It seemed plenty of time from Ryan's perspective, who lived only for twenty-three years. However, all his life, Nelron didn't have the chance to truly be free. He and his tribe only moved from one place to another in order to escape from the dungeon masters. Thanks to that, he never had the chance to see his world in its entirety, and it was rare for his species to live for long in the first place due to the constant battles. Hence, not a single dragon in his tribe, not even those that lived two times more, knew all the terrain of the world.

"To reach Deadly Swamp, we need to pass by the Giant Yellow Forest," Nelron said while he was drawing on the ground a map of the parts of the world he knew. "The swamp is seven days away from here, but the forest is only four. That is where the remaining members of my tribe are hidden."

"One week away?" Ryan frowned. "How fast are you guys anyway?"

"We can't leave traces behind, so we can only fly by using our wings," Nelron said. "That is not our specially, so it takes two more times than by running or leaping."

That was a weird explanation. Ryan could understand species that uses their running speed to measure distances but not leaping Regardless, they probably can solve that issue by using Teleport. Still, Ryan was more and more certain that bringing Alissa back to Earth might take weeks.

"How you were captured?" Femradiel asked. "I am assuming that you were when you moved away from your base, am I right?"

"Yes, there are three dungeon masters that fight nearby our territory, some of my friends were forced to fight them when their battle was getting closer to us," Nelron said. "However, I moved away from the group to defeat a group of goblin champions, I succeeded but the liches appeared out of nowhere and put me to sleep. My friends probably think that I am dead."

Ryan couldn't help but frown. The dragons of that world were much calmer than he had imagined considering their origins. Considering his experience with dragons, Ryan assumed that they would try to eat him a few times in order to obtain his power before giving so much information for free.

"Why are they so close to your base?" Ryan asked.

"Because recently, they found a mining spot for mithril there," Nelron replied.

"You guys' luck are that bad, huh," Ryan said.

"No that was bound to happen, whenever dragons stay in a place for too long, mining spots for mithril always appear," Nelron said. "Only a few dungeon masters know this, so please, don't spread this knowledge."

Ryan and Femradiel had no reason to spread that knowledge, but in the end, Ryan couldn't help but feel a bit interested in that mining spot. Perhaps mithril was the thing that he needed to power up and then recover his domain. Regardless, after that, Nelron showed the location of the dungeon masters and their locations. The one who Femradiel defeated was once in North, but the other three who are still kicking completely surrounded their paths on the South, East, and West. All of them were, at best, four days away from their base.

"How big are their armies and the kind of monsters they use?" Ryan asked.

"The dungeon masters use many species, but they focus on a few that are a difficult match against us," Nelron replied. "They are the Goblin Champions, Metallic Knights, and Death Knights. They are small, fast and can use weapons made of mithril, so it is quite difficult for us to face them due to our size."

Even the minions were using weapons made of mithril, which was worrisome in many ways. It means that their armies couldn't be underestimated in power nor in resources. While Ryan faced some Goblin Champions, he never faced one at the max level or using high-level gear. As for the other two species of monsters, they seemed pretty troublesome. Still, there was no point in worrying about them. Ryan had to see with his own eyes and confirm how dangerous they actually were.
