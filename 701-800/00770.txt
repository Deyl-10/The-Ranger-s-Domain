Chapter 771: See?

After gaining a boost in strength, Ryan teleported to the right above Tyr, and with all his might, he kicked him. Tyr was forced to move downward thanks to the impact. It was more than annoying to help the enemy by causing damage like that. Still, Tyr knew that this kind of effect could only work for so long, so he charged toward Ryan. By staying on the offense, he wouldn't let Ryan make use of that extra boost of energy. Ryan showed an expression of surprise when Tyr approached, but ultimately, Tyr was the one confused in the end. Ryan didn't try to block that attack and got hit in the face, and soon after that, an invisible force hit Tyr's face, and he felt the taste of blood on his mouth.

"A reflection skill" Tyr said, annoyed.

"Not quite," Ryan said and then pointed toward his mouth, which was also bleeding. "See? I still got damage."

There was no point in explaining to the enemy what he did, but it was obvious that Tyr would understand what Ryan did much sooner than later. Tyr was a rather straightforward individual. As soon as he heard what Ryan said, he charged once again. It was a bit troublesome to face someone so direct like that, but it was better than to face a target that could use long-ranged attacks and annoying skills.

Ryan repeated that same tactic of using Vengeful Explosion whenever possible to cause critical damage, but in the end, even though he could heal himself whenever he wanted, that plan alone wouldn't work forever. Ryan realized that after attacking Ryan's chest, Tyr moved his arm and then protected his own chest and blocked the Vengeful Explosion. He had already found one weakness of that skill it could only reflect damage on the same place the caster suffered the attack.

"What a boring skill," Tyr said.

"You think so?" Ryan asked.

Tyr charged toward Ryan again, but then he used Teleport to escape. For some reason, he teleported to ground level and then used the skill again after a while to other places. Tyr found that weird, but then he realized why Ryan did that he picked the mithril pieces of his armor and helmet that fell due to his attacks. As if that wasn't enough, he saw Ryan swallowing some pieces of the mithril.

"I hope that I won't bore you with this," Ryan said.

Ryan used all that extra mana to create a massive arrow of solidified light. Tyr dashed at Ryan before he could use all that extra mana to his attack, but in the end, he didn't escape it since Ryan used Perfect Aim and Deadly Aim. Tyr completely ignored the attack since it didn't become powerful enough to deal critical damage. However, the projectile of light still blinded him for a few seconds.

Although he couldn't see it, Tyr could feel that Ryan didn't move an inch, and apparently, he wasn't planning any attack either. When the light dissipated, Tyr saw Ryan massaging his shoulders. Soon afterward, Ryan disappeared, and then Tyr felt something hitting him from above.

"What" Tyr muttered.

Ryan's physical strength increased a lot in just a few seconds, and Tyr couldn't understand what he did. In terms of raw power, he still wasn't at Alissa's level, but he far surpassed his previous strength.

"What did you do?" Tyr asked when he landed on the ground.

"I used many boring tricks," Ryan said.

Ryan teleported once again, but Tyr reacted on time to grab his fist that almost hit his back. Without any other choice, Tyr used Absolute Appraisal, and he saw his skills. Still, much to his surprise, he saw Ryan turning into his human-size, and then a mithril sword appeared on his hands. Tyr felt danger while looking at that sword, and then he jumped backward, but Ryan used Teleport and hit him in mid-air. Tyr used his forearm to block the attack, but then he used Teleport once he saw the sword cutting his arm like butter.

"Oh? You can use Teleport as well," Ryan said. "I guess you don't use it often because you would rather scare your enemies directly."

Ryan stored the sword away since it was too risky to use it often and stay in his human form. Also, for the first time, Tyr used healing spells to fix his arm. Before Tyr could recover from the surprise, Ryan approached by using Teleport again. Instead of counter-attacking, Tyr used his axes to block Ryan's punch. His eyes moved around, waiting to be attacked by that sword. It seemed it had been a while since he felt that tense.

Ryan's plan was working. He used STR potions and even Anger Manipulation to level up his Rage. However, he couldn't get carried away. His plan could be working right now, but Tyr was yet to show his true strength. Besides, Ryan wanted to buy time. He couldn't risk losing before Femradiel could open Alissa's eyes. Suddenly, the atmosphere changed, and then Ryan heard it

"HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHH!"

It was Alissa's voice something happened, and Ryan began to sweat cold. Femradiel was taking her time, to begin with, so it was evident that things didn't go as planned. Ryan clenched his fist and bit his lips. He couldn't afford to waste any more time with Tyr. He will have to defeat him himself.

When Tyr looked at Ryan's eyes, he couldn't help but flinch. Things were going to change after that point, and Tyr couldn't help but feel excited as well.
