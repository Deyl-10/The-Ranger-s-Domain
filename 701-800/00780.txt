Chapter 781: Hard to kill

"This is a fine sword," Hephaestus said. "Where did you get it? This type of Enchantment is quite rare."

Ryan couldn't help but feel that he was being mocked. A sword almost pierced Hephaestus' heart, and he was asking who forged the weapon Regardless, it was time for plan B it was time to formulate plan B. Fortunately, the next plan was formulated pretty fast. If Hephaestus needed that heat to make his body stronger, Ryan knew the place where he wouldn't be able to keep that spell active without paying a high price.

Ryan teleported to high in the sky and then eventually, to space. Hephaestus followed him as if that wasn't a real problem. In the end, the heat followed him. Apparently, it was an advanced spell that created a barrier, and the interior created a perfect environment for Hephaestus. Still, how much mana did he have to do that?

"You sure have a lot of mana," Ryan said.

"We all have," Hephaestus said. "If Poseidon didn't try to hurry and be the first to return to Earth, he would have a near limitless supply of mana and you wouldn't have defeated him."

"What about Thanatos?" Ryan asked.

"Use your brain and come up with the answer yourself," Hephaestus replied.

Unfortunately, Ryan didn't have time for that. Still to think that the elder gods could store so much mana in their bodies It was no wonder that Ryan couldn't actually kill Poseidon and Thanatos. They probably could recover much more health than Ryan could cause damage without using attacks that have divine energy.

Even by using Fly, Hephaestus was fast enough to make Ryan feel shivers in outer space. His speed didn't decrease one bit, and now Ryan had to worry about his sense of depth since the landmarks in outer space were far away stars. However, amidst his anxiety, Ryan had another idea it was another thing that he could do once. Still, he couldn't afford to miss it as dangerous as that looked once again.

After teleporting around again, Ryan fooled Hephaestus by swallowing another piece of mithril. He used to catch Ryan off guard, but in the end, Ryan suddenly turned around and then opened his mouth. Hephaestus felt some danger and was forced to slow down since he saw darkness within Ryan's eyes, but that had been too late Ryan used Dark Ice Breath.

Hephaestus tried to protect his face, but Ryan aimed at the wound on his chest. When Hephaestus noticed that, it was too late. His entire body had been frozen and covered by a thick layer of the dark ice. Once again, Ryan stopped before the corruption could take over his mind and body. Still, he panicked since he couldn't see anything the corruption had taken over his head almost entirely. After taking some deep breaths and using Anger Manipulation, Ryan managed to calm down and recover his vision, but that scared the crap out of him.

"This is such an amazing attack, but it is a pity I can use it only once," Ryan sighed in relief.

Ryan wasted a lot of time trying to recover. Thanks to it, he could see some cracks around the dark ice. Fortunately, his own attack completely countered Hephaestus, so that heat wasn't the thing destroying the ice. It was Hephaestus' will alone.

Before Hephaestus could free himself, Ryan created the biggest ice spear he had ever made. Creating ice and making it harder was just too easy in outer space due to the temperature. Ryan swallowed mithril until he felt his limbs growing a number he had eaten too much. However, in exchange for that, he had created a five kilometers long ice spear it wasn't at the level of the one Poseidon used against him, but it was the best he could use.

When the dark ice finally broke, Ryan fired his ice spear, and at the last moment, Ryan saw Hephaestus clenching his teeth. The spear hit the target and then immediately proceeded to push him downward at a fearsome speed. Hephaestus tried to fight, but he had the strength to do it, not even in his enormous size.

It took only a single second for Hephaestus to reach and be crushed on the ground of that planet. Even from so far away, Ryan couldn't even begin to imagine the size of that world, but from that distance, he saw the impact of his attack. All the clouds in the area moved to the distance, and they gave up the place to a single cloud of dust. It only lasted for a single second as well, but Ryan felt the whole world tremble.

" Where are my coins?" Ryan asked.

Ryan received many notifications, but not a single one of them made him aware of his victory he knew that defeating an elder god with an ordinary attack wouldn't be easy, but that was a bit too much.

It was dangerous, but Ryan was forced to approach the point of the impact. If Hephaestus didn't get up, it means that he was heavily wounded, and that means that Ryan had to finish the job as soon as possible but that also could be a trap. Either way, Ryan just accepted the inevitable and approached. Hopefully, he didn't make Hephaestus fall where Femradiel and Alissa were fighting. Ryan couldn't tell since he didn't have time to consider anything while he was fighting.
