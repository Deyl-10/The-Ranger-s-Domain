Chapter 760: No Shit

Chapter 760: No shit

In the end, Nakine decided to use the same strategy. Ryan and Femradiel will deal with the dungeon masters, and his group will fight the minions and the dragons. Once the first dungeon master falls, the tide of the battle will change since they will gain fifty allies.

"Since that is the strategy, we will just take with us anyone that can actually fight right now," Nakine said. "It would be better if some of them could gain the power of the crystal in our village, but I suppose it can't be helped."

That annoyed Ryan a little. While it was true that things would be more convenient if he waited for the others, he didn't want to stay away from Earth for an entire month. Ten days had already passed, and he didn't have the chance to check things with Arthur and Zoe even a single time during this time. That kind of worry might cause ulcers in his stomach someday

As soon as night fell, the group left the second village and headed toward their destination. After a few hours, they found the place where they could see all of the three dungeons with the help of Clairvoyance. Weirdly enough, the dungeons were in some islands that could be found in the largest lake of that world, and it was called the Mythical Fountain since one of the seventh dragons that escaped from the claws of the corruption spent more of their time there.

"Obviously, they are much more powerful than my Golems," Ryan thought. "Still, it seems they have more than a few tricks up their sleeves."

Dragging too much that fight against the dungeon masters might cause some problems since the Golems had high endurance and long-ranged attacks. While that was his plan anyway, perhaps Ryan will have to increase his pace even more than usual.

"Maybe we should split up the work again, Femradiel," Ryan said.

"Not happening," Femradiel said. "We will be faster if we work together, not to mention, I also have a bad feeling today"

"How ominous of you to say that soon before an important battle" Ryan said.

Despite his words, Ryan engraved Femradiel's words in his heart. She was smart and had good instincts, so the chances of them finding something weird on the other side of the dungeon were pretty high.

Ryan looked around, trying to find a moon in the sky, but he didn't find one. It was a pity, but he had other options. After selecting the Electric Golems dungeon, he looked for the bosses' location and, after memorizing them, decided to put his plan into motion.

"All right, we are going," Ryan said. "You can attack when you see fit, but if I were you, I would attack as soon as we enter the dungeon."

"Understood," Nakine said.

Ryan and Femradiel approached the dungeon, but they didn't rush it since the dragons would have to follow them from behind. In the end, they only attacked when they were close enough to the dungeon to teleport to the entrance. Ryan summoned the Absolute Death Crossbow and pulled the trigger several times in an arrow, making the bosses' head explode instantly. The creatures had no chance of defending against it, so it was only natural that they would fall without putting up much of a fight.

Ryan was holding Soul Eater in order not to run out of mana. Still, once he finished the bosses, Femradiel was the one who teleported them to the interior of the dungeon. Once they were there, they rushed to find the last part of the dungeon. Hopefully, they would find the dungeon master waiting for them there as well, but that didn't happen. Ryan and Femradiel only found the purple crystal.

When they touched the crystal, they felt the environment change drastically. If the dragon worlds were night, on the next one, it was a day. Things were as bright as they could be since Ryan and Femradiel appeared in the middle of a scorching desert. Before they could look for the enemy, the enemy found them but naturally, things wouldn't be simple like that they saw themselves surrounded by a massive army of bald men wearing a weird set of armor that reflected a lot of the light no, it wasn't an army of bald men it was several copies of a single man.

"It seems the surprise attack failed," Femradiel said.

"No shit, Sherlock," Ryan said.

Ryan tried to use Appraisal on those creatures, but the skill didn't work. Not even Absolute Appraisal worked, which showed that those weren't real they were illusions. Regardless, it wasn't time to wonder about that. Ryan used Draconic Transformation and began to fly toward the illusory copies while using Ice Breath. That certainly was the best way to destroy the copies and then find out the original. Still, as usual, it would take a while for Ryan to understand that things wouldn't be that simple.
