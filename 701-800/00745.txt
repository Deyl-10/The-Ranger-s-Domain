Chapter 745: Feeling

"Did I miss something?" Ryan asked. "The dungeon still is active, but where are the monsters?"

"Maybe Nelron's friends defeated them in battle and the dungeon master is recovering from the damage on their world," Femradiel said.

"No that is impossible," Nelron said. "We don't have enough power to even defeat a single army of goblin champions and the other two species are even stronger, so"

Even Nelron was confused since he never heard of any story where the entire army of monsters left their dungeon. Even when a big fight is about to happen, the dungeon masters always make sure to use only half of their minions.

Something happened, and weirdly enough, those three reached the same conclusion at the exact same moment. That army found the giant forest and then decided to strike it was a rather risky move. Still, it was understandable, if the dungeon master knew that the other remaining enemy also found where the dragons were hiding. Upon realizing that, Nelron jumped with all his might. Although his body was pretty heavy, the strength of his legs made him look like he was flying. In just a few seconds, he disappeared in the distance.

"Shouldn't we go with him?" Femradiel asked.

"We can arrive faster than him," Ryan rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "First, we need to consider our options. Isn't weird that they found this tribe at this point in time? I can't believe that our luck can be this bad."

"As always, you worry too much," Femradiel said. "It was only a matter of time before they could be found."

That seemed logical, but Ryan couldn't help but wonder about that timing it was just too weird. Lately, that kind of feeling has only been returning to him on a daily basis. Like everything that happened had some sort of trigger, and that would always cause a lot of trouble to him, but in the end, the result would be really beneficial to him if he succeeds in solving the issue. After all, he would gain a lot by saving a tribe of dragons. They would feel indebted to him, and even more since he is considering selling a domain to them.

Ryan wanted to think more about those weird coincidences, but that could be done later. He used Teleport, and then they easily catch up to Nelron. While Ryan was busy using Teleport, Femradiel was busy restoring his mana with Sapphire Arrows and by using Mana-Eater to absorb the mana of the loot they just obtained. Thanks to the mithril, the items had a lot more mana than before, so Femradiel could use a single piece of armor for dozens of times.

In order to make sure that they wouldn't arrive too late, Ryan even used Draconic Transformation. It wasn't time to worry about being tracked by the most powerful dungeon masters of that world. Thanks to that, they arrived on the Giant Yellow Forest in less than half an hour a trip that would take three days if they had relied on the legs of Nelron alone. Ryan's limbs were asleep since he used too much mana in such a short amount of time, but he didn't have time to rest because the forest was on fire and two armies were attacking from sides. They were the Metallic Knights and the Death Knights.

No wonder Nelron said that those two species were stronger than the goblin champions. They probably covered their weapons and armor with mithril because without it. They would stand no chance against the Death Knights and Metallic Knights. Still, Ryan wished that he had asked more about those creatures because he couldn't help but feel surprised at the fact that the Metallic Knights were essentially robots and that the Death Knights were like a massive pile of bones.

The Death Knights had health and stamina because, in the end, bones were organic parts of a body, but the Metallic Knights didn't have a single organic part. That was why they didn't have health and stamina.

"It is just me or it is weird that those creatures are made of a single type of thing?" Ryan asked.

Instead of answering the question, Nelron flew toward the battlefield. The forest was massive from all angles, so it was clear that they were only seeing a small part of the entire conflict. While some of the monsters were fighting against each other on the Southern entrance of the forest, Ryan could see some dragons flying a few kilometers ahead in the North and being attacked by a massive number of both species.

"What is the plan?" Femradiel asked.

"You should go and help Nelron," Ryan replied. "I will look for the dungeon masters, I have a feeling that they here somewhere"
