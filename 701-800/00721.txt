Chapter 721: Time Mage

Chapter 721: Time Mage

While Femradiel was freezing some T-Rexes to death, Ryan checked his skill list in order to find inspiration. He needed to spend those 340 million coins somehow, but Ryan had no idea how to do it. Thanks to that, he noticed that his Ice Breath leveled up quite a bit since the last time he checked. Against Thanatos, it seemed the skill leveled forty times.

"I don't remember using that much against Thanatos" Ryan frowned.

"It is probably because you used an enhanced version," Femradiel replied. "Instead of mana, the corruption and your rage fueled the attack. Thanks to that, it froze even Thanatos for a while."

"Rage doesn't make magic attacks stronger," Ryan said.

"No, but it does strengthen the corruption on your body and that strengthens the Ice Breath," Femradiel added. "You saw, didn't you? How much that attack changed. Instead of creating plain ice, it created a dark one."

Ryan checked and confirmed that Rage leveled up quite a lot as well. More than thirty times it was a bit embarrassing for Ryan since the cause of it was the fact that Thanatos killed Femradiel. He knew that as long as he lived, she would return, but that didn't change the fact that he went mad like that. To the point where he couldn't even remember a single thing about a massive part of the fight.

Soul Armor Lv 04

Effect: It grants you the power to use souls to create an armor that will protect you against all kinds of attacks, with the exception of divine or corrupt attacks.

Current Amount of Damage that can be nullified. 10.630

Ryan also recalled one of the skills he obtained when he defeated Thanatos. Soul Armor was weird. It could only work when he defeats an opponent. When Femradiel does it, it doesn't work. The same thing can be applied to Soul Manipulation. When Ryan defeats a monster, he can feel their souls, but when he doesn't Regardless, each soul that becomes part of the Soul Armor can nullify ten points of damage for each level. So, it has potential.

"This is taking too long," Ryan said and then sighed since he didn't get a single new class after clearing five tier three dungeons. "Maybe we should just head to Belphegor's dungeon once and for all."

"Not fair, you are complaining just because I am finally catching up with the number of classes," Femradiel said. "Besides, it is not like you are not gaining anything by clearing these dungeons."

Ryan could obtain extra dexterity and extra status points in every dungeon he clears, so Femradiel was correct, but he still couldn't help but complain. Fortunately, when they cleared a Pterodactyls' dungeon in Madrid, capital of Spain, he finally obtained a new class and a pretty good one, actually.

Congratulations! You have cleared the dungeon and obtained its treasure! As a reward for your achievement, you can obtain one of the three following classes: Death Knight, Mad Archer, and Time Mage.

Please be aware that clearing this dungeon again won't give you the chance to unlock the other remaining classes. If you want to obtain them, you will have to search for those in other dungeons.

Congratulations! You have become a Level one Time Mage!

"Oh! It can't be compared to the effects of Chronos' Ring, but it is a pretty good start," Ryan smirked.

"Maybe we should have skipped this dungeon, after all," Femradiel said with her left eyebrow raised.

"All you do is complain," Ryan shrugged.

"You are the one who complains all the time!" Femradiel protested.

"Anyway, let's train Haste as much as possible," Ryan said. "This skill should help us a lot against tougher enemies. Although I don't remember the entire fight against Thanatos, I remember that my speed was an issue."

"How weird that we obtained these skills so easily" Femradiel frowned. "I am pretty sure that even among dragons, few of them have skills that grant them the power to control time."

"While those skills are impressive, I believe you are wrong about them," Ryan said. "Instead of controlling time, they speed up our bodies. It isn't the same thing."

Ryan was right, but even that much should be beyond the power of humans. One thing that confirmed that was that Femradiel never saw those skills being sold on her monster's system. It was almost as if

"I guess you don't have enough mana and recovery to keep the skill on for long periods of time," Ryan said. "Too bad I can't transform either, since that makes my presence easier to recognize. It looks like we will have to use a lot of potions. Wait I know how I can spend those coins."

Ryan began to grin from ear to ear when he finally recalled a certain thing. He had that idea a few months ago, but he never found a solution, but perhaps with the coins he had now, perhaps
