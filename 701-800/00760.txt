Chapter 761: Surprise

Ryan's Ice Breath made the copies disappear, but after a few moments, they would appear on the same spot as if nothing had happened. Ryan was fast but not fast enough to destroy all of those at the same time. After five laps, Ryan grew tired of that and decided to change his plans.

"Can you pinpoint the dungeon master's position, Femradiel?" Ryan asked.

"No this larger concentration of mana is messing with my senses," Femradiel said.

The large concentration of mana was due to the illusions, there were close to ten thousand copies, so it wasn't surprising that they were messing with Femradiel senses. Those fuckers were being used to fool their eyes and other senses as well.

For some reason, the dungeon master wasn't attacking Ryan. In fact, it was kind of hard to say that the dungeon master was nearby. One mistake, and the creature might get hit by Ryan's Ice Breath. Once that happens, Ryan can easily find the original. In the end, Ryan tried to move away from that spot in order to find the crystal of the domain. Once he does that, finding the dungeon master should be easier. However, the illusory copies followed him while maintaining their perfect circle.

Ryan decided to ignore them, but as it turned out, they weren't there just to make him waste his time. Ryan and Femradiel noticed that their eyesight was getting blurry, not because of the heat of the desert but because of the copies.

Congratulations! Your Illusion Resistance has leveled up.

"It seems the mana they are emanating is affecting our bodies," Femradiel said.

Ryan sighed. He was getting impatient again, but it was only natural since he couldn't waste time in a place like that. Without any other choice, Ryan summoned his magic bows and then used them alongside Arrow Shower. Much faster than before, the illusions were destroyed and took a while for those to reappear, but Ryan achieved his goal of stopping the mana from messing with their senses. It was a bit of a risky plan since Ryan was using too much mana, but so was the dungeon master keeping the fuckers active.

In the end, Ryan's plan of expanding his mana to make the dungeon spend even more mana worked. Very suddenly, Femradiel stopped watching the battle and then looked above them.

"I sense something above us," Femradiel said.

"Why so sudden?" Ryan asked. "Are you sure it isn't a trap?"

"I felt something like a large concentration of mithril most likely, the dungeon master is running out of batteries," Femradiel said.

Ryan teleported to above, and then he saw the very moment a small point began to disappear. The dungeon master was really controlling the illusions from above Regardless, his plan of running away again didn't work because Ryan's Absolute Appraisal and his eyes were very good.

"What a dumbass he didn't keep Mind Armor or any spell like that active," Ryan said.

Before the enemy could, Ryan used Search and found the asshole's location. Without wasting any time, Ryan and Femradiel bombarded the area with magic projectiles. Ryan would have finished the creature with the Absolute Death Crossbow if he could, but he needed to see the enemy for the projectiles to work.

In the end, the attacks worked and forced the dungeon master to cancel the illusions by using Mana Barrier. That being said, the creature didn't receive any damage. Tarragon was exactly like his copies, so Ryan didn't take notice of his appearance. Instead of that, he kept firing arrows as he flew toward the dungeon master. The creature didn't do anything aside from trying to escape in his semi-indestructible barrier of mana.

"It seems he can't use his illusions inside the Mana Barrier," Femradiel said.

"Let's not jump to conclusions," Ryan said. "The last time I did that, I lost all the scales on this body."

Femradiel wasn't the type to underestimate her foes, but prudence was necessary more than ever. Still, Ryan could tell by looking at the dungeon master that she was probably right. The creature was completely taken by fear given how many years the dungeon master has been capturing dragons, Ryan assumed that was insane. Unless he didn't have much experience in situations like those, where he couldn't use his best powers.

Using the Absolute Death Crossbow seemed a bit too much for an enemy of that level. Still, Ryan didn't hesitate in using the Vibrating Crossbow. The creature trembled from head to toe when the Mana Barrier began to shake. However, despite that, the dungeon master eventually stopped, and Ryan stopped as well, not because he didn't need to chase the dungeon master any longer, but because he saw two others approaching, and they were pretty identical with the first one. Not only that, they were using the same pieces of armor.

"What the hell is going on here?" Ryan frowned.

"In the end, my instincts are always right" Femradiel said.

It didn't take long for Ryan to connect the dots. The three dungeon masters didn't have the same skills, preference for monsters. They were competing with one another for no reason but because they were from the same species and lived in the same world.
