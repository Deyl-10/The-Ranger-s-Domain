In the end, Ryan turned one of the cursed dragons into a massive dark sword. Still, he acted without thinking since he didn't have time. He ended up creating a big sword made of steel by using Word Creation. Still, the result wasn't so bad.

The remaining dragon even hesitated a little while looking at the dark sword on Ryan's hands, probably because he could tell that he was about to face the same destiny deep down.

Instead of wasting any time, Ryan dashed at the cursed dragon, the beast retreated. Still, in the end, it exploded even before Ryan could kill it. Ryan frowned while looking at Thanatos. He was making a bored expression for some reason. In any case, it looked like he was trying to give Ryan even more reasons to be killed by him.

"In the end, you can't expect much from a mad dog," Thanatos said. "Still, you have my congratulations for making two cursed dragons look so stupid. Are you sure you don't want to become one? I am sure you will become much more impressive than them."

"Go to hell," Ryan said.

"I have visited there once, it was a pretty boring place, so I have no reason to return," Thanatos said. "From my perspective, the Greek underworld is much more interesting. Instead of putting all the damned souls in a single place, we divide them into circles. For each type of sin, you humans have followed most. For foolish and greedy humans like you, the fourth circle is perfect. Being crushed by all eternity by your own greed."

"You are welcome to try to send me there," Ryan said.

"Not yet," Thanatos said. "The fun has just begun. As I told you, it is hard to find a worthy human killing, and even though I like this place, it is difficult to find entertainment. In any case, it is about time to make you face some others a bit smarter than you."

Ryan and Femradiel couldn't help but be paralyzed in shock when he saw two figures appearing in front of Thanatos. Ryan knew them very well since he faced them recently.

When Ryan used Appraisal, he confirmed that the summoned guardians lost their status as humans and even obtained some extra power thanks to Thanatos. He couldn't recall their attributes exactly. Still, he was one hundred percent sure that their health, mana, and stamina have increased at least by thirty percent.

"This should make things more interesting; don't you agree?" Thanatos asked while smiling. "It is rare to find such souls nowadays. The human race isn't any more a species that creates such warriors."

Ryan clenched his teeth while looking at those two. Not only they grew stronger, but Ryan also could tell by looking in their eyes that they weren't ordinary zombies. Their eyes were filled with anger and grudge Most likely, Thanatos offered them a chance to revive and face Ryan once again. He didn't brainwash them to turn into mindless creatures that follow every single of his orders without thinking. Still, in a way, that made them even more dangerous. Ryan and Femradiel defeated them once, but only one at a time. Their chances this time were rather small.

"It looks like we did well in trying to fight Thanatos at this point in time," Femradiel said. "Later in the game, things could have become much messier if he had the opportunity to summon others like them."

While that seemed logical, for some reason, Ryan felt that in the end, nothing would change all that much from Thanatos' perspective. Since he was much more powerful than them, summoning more or fewer creatures like those two wouldn't change things from him. At least according to the face he was making. If Ryan and Femradiel were to have trouble dealing with them again, their chances of defeating Thanatos would be extremely low.

Alfur began to fly toward Ryan while Dracula began to steal his mana. As expected, they wouldn't fight mindlessly. While taking his time seemed like a bad idea, Ryan decided to do exactly what they wanted for some odd reason. When Alfur attacked him, Ryan used Shapeshifting. He blocked his advance with two arms and then attacked him with four others. Unfortunately, he didn't cause much damage, even though he had used Holy Enchantment.
