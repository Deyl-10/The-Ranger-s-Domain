Chapter 765: Alissa

Chapter 765: Alissa

Ryan was wondering that himself. Most likely, it was just a method to create a copy. But from another perspective, Orgar didn't die, so he couldn't be revived Ryan couldn't help but wonder if Alissa had those questions in her mind. She probably thought of that, and that was why she was looking for the knowledge of dragons. The older they are, the more knowledge they have, after all.

Nakine said that the trio would last for six hours, but since Ryan was using Soul Eater, it only took them one hour to reach the region where the battle had taken place. There were some mountains here and there, but overall, the place was basically a massive grassland a massive grassland that was trembling in hundreds of kilometers in all directions because some crazy individuals were fighting.

Ryan and Femradiel approached a bit more slowly while trying to hide their presence since the battle seemed lively, so most likely, Alissa still was fine. After a while, they found Femradiel in her draconic form. In the end, she wasn't much different from Ryan. The dark marks on her body were even more prominent and more considerable. The only difference was that the other parts weren't blue but silver.

Ryan tried to check her status, but he failed. In the end, he quickly forgot about that; when Alissa opened her mouth, a massive cannon of light flew to the distance. Ryan and Femradiel didn't even have the chance to check the enemy, and they imagined they would never have the chance to do so because Alissa's attack left a path of destruction. The beam of energy even melted the ground still, what surprised Ryan was the fact that her attack didn't have any signs of corruption.

In any case, after a few moments, a certain figure fell from the sky and then landed on the magma as if it was nothing. The figure was wearing a full set of mithril equipment and resembled a human quite a lot. The red hair and the red eyes that had a transparent glow. It was really an elder god, but that one was different from all the others. He was taller, and instead of special armor and weapons, he only had simple items made of mithril. They probably were possible, but they didn't look more powerful than Thanatos' scythe and Poseidon's trident.

The elder god had two short axes in his hands. He also had a horned helmet on his head. If it weren't for the whole plate armor that he was using, Ryan would think that he was some Norse elder god.

"Tyr? Isn't that the Norse god of war?" Ryan frowned. "Oh, boy... things just keep getting better and better."

Now the two axes started to make sense. Still, Ryan didn't imagine that a Norse elder god would use full plate armor. Regardless, even though the armor seemed pretty durable, Tyr decided to dodge the attack. Thanks to that, Alissa was hesitating. Even from far away, Ryan could hear her fist and teeth clenching. She looked angry as hell. If Ryan approaches suddenly, he might become the next target.

"What is the plan?" Femradiel asked. "This is going to be very difficult."

"It doesn't look like she needs our help right now, even though they have been fighting for over an hour, their bodies are almost completely fine," Ryan said. "I am more worried about the fact that we can only see Tyr. Not to mention, his army of monsters isn't around."

After using Clairvoyance, Ryan found the dungeon a few kilometers away, and he found an army of winged creatures whose bodies were covered in fur. They didn't seem that powerful, so Ryan decided to ignore them. Tyr suddenly charged toward Alissa, and instead of blocking the attack, she tried to slice in half with her claws, but in the end, her hands and the axes were the only things that collided. For some reason, Tyr looked a bit bigger, maybe it was the tension in the muscles he was exercising, or perhaps it was due to something else. Still, Ryan couldn't help but frown at it since he was three meters tall.

In the end, Alissa began to lose the contest of strength. Still, in the end, she clenched her teeth, and without activating any skill, she suddenly began to push Tyr backward. It was kind of shocking to see an elder god losing such a direct confrontation. Ryan didn't imagine humans would be able to do that. He didn't expect that any human would be crazy enough to fight them without some preparations.

In any case, it was a pretty good chance for Alissa to use some spells right now. Even if her hands were busy, there were plenty of ways for her to attack an enemy that couldn't move. She probably could use the Magic Bow, but for some reason, she never used it. After winning the contest for a while, Alissa decided to step back for a short while. She did so in order to gain some distance and prepare a big punch. Tyr was caught off guard, and even though he tried to block the attack with the axes, he was sent flying backward for several kilometers.

"Something is off" Femradiel said. "Alissa gained a buff in strength without using any spell, item or potion."

"Maybe Rage helped her with that," Ryan said.

"Do you really think she only began to use Rage now?" Femradiel asked. "Are you an idiot?"

"Hey, there is no need to offend me," Zaos furrowed his eyebrows. "In any case, I guess I am an idiot."
