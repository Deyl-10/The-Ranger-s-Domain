Chapter 755: New Species

Ryan's plan was to divide and conquer. That was why he was planning to leave Femradiel and the dragons behind to wipe out the army. However, once the fight starts, things might become messed up for them. He will try to take one of the dungeon masters as soon as possible, but the other will face Femradiel and the others. That plan was just too risky Still, Ryan made an agreement with Nakine, and those two dungeon masters captured some dragons.

"When are your friends going to be ready to help us?" Ryan asked. "We are wasting precious time and we can't afford to waste any."

"Most armies of the dungeon masters have at least fifty thousand monsters, so we are planning to divide our forces in two groups: attack and defense," Nakine replied. "At this moment, considering the number of monsters spawned, we probably reached that mark, so they will start to move the armies. Still, only two of them reached a decent level."

In the end, Ryan couldn't count on the army unless the dragons had some other tricks up their sleeve. Regardless, Ryan didn't want to wait for too long. Considering how strong those two species of monsters were, even a massive attack coming from above won't decimate all of them. Not to mention, it was hard to imagine that Ryan will have enough power to do so.

"Get ready for battle, in the end, we can't invade their domains," Ryan said.

"So, you are planning to fight here?" Femradiel asked.

"Yeah, we can't split up and face the two dungeon masters at the same time, so it can't be helped," Ryan said.

"Well, I prefer things like that anyway," Femradiel said.

"You sure sound relaxed," Ryan said. "Oh, wait. Why I didn't get used to this by now?"

"That is because I am confident, I forgot to mention it, but I didn't find any traces of divinity in this area," Femradiel said. "Most likely, we aren't dealing with the elder gods here."

"Why didn't you inform me of that earlier" Ryan facepalmed. "So, we made a mistake assuming that only the elder gods could cause Alissa some trouble I don't know if this is a good thing or not. Anyway, get ready for a change of plans. If we attack the army and the dungeon masters don't show up as fast as possible, we will have to split up and face them on their domains."

"Roger that," Femradiel said.

Ryan and Femradiel teleported to high in the sky, leaving the dragons behind because they didn't have any long-ranged attack that could help them right now. Ryan created another sphere of highly concentrated mana that is about to turn into a sphere of ice. Meanwhile, Femradiel created a massive electric spear. While she wasn't used to that kind of elemental attack, it was the only thing she could do at the moment.

Unfortunately, before they could finish their attacks, Ryan and Femradiel felt two presences leaving the dungeons. Ryan didn't have time to use Clairvoyance, so he fired the sphere, and Femradiel soon after did the same. Their attacks froze and shocked a good portion of the monsters, but not even one-third of the monsters were killed.

"Damn" Ryan clicked his tongue in annoyance. "That wasn't something I expected"

"Let's get going," Femradiel said.

Their attacks stopped the dungeon masters, but even so, that wouldn't last forever. After using Teleport, Ryan and Femradiel arrived right above the dungeons and in front of those two creatures. Ryan didn't see that transparent glow in the enemies' eyes, but he didn't drop his guard.

The two creatures looked pretty similar, so Ryan assumed that they came from the same planet. They didn't have any hair on their bodies, but instead of it, they had some crystal-looking parts on the front of their bodies. The crystal of the first one was blue, and the other was red. As for their skin, it didn't look quite like the humans. It was rough gray with traces of yellow that made it look like bones. Maybe that was some kind of full plate armor. At least that was what Ryan assumed since they weren't any clothes. Their eyes also had the same color of the crystal in front of their bodies, and they were filled with anger since Ryan and Femradiel decimated an excellent part of their army.

Usually, Ryan and Femradiel would attack mercilessly to make things end as soon as possible. Still, first, they needed to have a good idea of what the enemies could do, in order to grant Nakine and his friends a good chance to face the remaining army of monsters. Before anyone could do anything, Femradiel suddenly used Teleport and then covered the blue dungeon master with ice and then teleported both of them to somewhere else.

"I will take care of this one," Femradiel said via Telepathy.

" Just don't go too far away," Ryan said. "They might be planning some kind of trap, so keep your guard up."

Despite the surprise attack, the red dungeon master didn't even flinch. Either the creature didn't care about their partner, or they did have extreme confidence in them. Either way, Ryan couldn't afford to think about it. He had to move the battle to somewhere else, and then the pendragons would have the chance to face the zombies even though they were more or less than the same amount of health, mana, and stamina.

"Let's go somewhere else," The red dungeon master said. "I don't want to use my monsters against you, nor do I want them to get caught in this fight."
