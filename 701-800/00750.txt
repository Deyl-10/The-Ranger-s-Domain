"By the look of surprise in your face, I would say that I won," Femradiel smirked.

"How did you do it?" Ryan asked. "You made the monsters level up one hundred more times, but it doesn't look like you caused a dungeon break or two."

"That is a secret," Femradiel smiled proudly.

Ryan knew that he wasn't as smart as Femradiel, but even so, it didn't take long for him to understand what she did. He lost by too large of a margin, considering that they basically could use the same skills. There was only one thing she could have done that would break the balance of the competition

"How many coins did you use?" Ryan asked.

" Not many," Femradiel's smile froze as she said that.

"How many?" Ryan asked.

" Three hundred million," Femradiel hesitated, but in the end, she spat out.

Ryan facepalmed and stayed like that for quite a while that woman was crazy. That was enough to buy another Soul Eater, and she spends it to level up an army of monsters that wasn't hers. Maybe that could become a good investment later. Still, even an army of ten thousand of level five hundred chimeras could do more than them.

"Well, whatever it was your coins anyway," Ryan said after a long sigh. "Let's got get the mithril."

"And here I was thinking that you would complain for the next few days," Femradiel frowned. "Perhaps I should have made a more interesting bet and then used all my coins."

After saying what he said, Ryan couldn't even complain anymore. Regardless, at least Femradiel decided not to make her demands for the time being. They headed toward the Giant Yellow Forest and found their reward waiting for them without wasting any more time.

"Hey, you are back," Nelron said. "It seems that you did a much better job than we expected."

"Yeah? How so?" Ryan asked.

"Ah, about that" Nelron said nervously.

"I used Telepathy to talk with those three that are controlling the domains and we heard about the progress," Nakine said after hitting the top of the head of his son. "That is why we know that you did more than we expected."

It made sense that Nakine talked with his friends by using Telekinesis. Still, given Nelron's actions, Ryan concluded that they obtained that information by using a different method one that those dragons had to keep quiet about. Keeping that secret would be difficult, as long as Nelron's doesn't shut up.

Regardless, putting that aside, Ryan proceeded to store his mithril. He now had plenty of material to create as many weapons as he wanted. Still, he will need to practice for quite a while before he reaches a level where he can craft weapons as powerful as Poseidon's trident and Thanatos' scythe.

"What about the second part of our deal?" Ryan asked.

"We didn't break our promise and we found your friend," Nakine said. "After defeating the dungeon master in the deadly swamp, she kept moving Eastward and apparently she defeated two other dungeon masters. However, yesterday, your friend was fighting against two of the most powerful of the dungeon masters they were a part of the group who captured us and used our allies to strengthen their armies."

"Did she win?" Ryan asked.

"No, in the place she fought, one could only find a massive crater where no one can find the bottom," Nakine replied. "When their powers collided, that hole was the only thing left in the scene. However, we found the monsters that worked for the dungeon masters working in the area and looking for them and their levels hadn't decreased."

Ryan assumed that the three of them survived the massive blast, but the dungeon masters probably retreated due to their wounds. As for Alissa, she was probably alive as well, but her condition was unknown.

"Where did the battle happen?" Ryan asked.

"Near the First Ice Mountains," Nakine replied. "If we use your speed while using Teleport, you can arrive there in four days."

Ryan and Femradiel frowned. They assumed that Nakine was considering the speed they could move while using all their mana and keeping the focus necessary to eat the mana away from the mithril on the items like there was no tomorrow. Just how massive was that planet? Ryan and Femradiel were pretty sure that they could move two or three times around the planet with the mana they used to travel from the first domain they obtained to the Giant Yellow Forest, and it seemed that they will have to cover a distance that was sixteen times greater than that.

"Do you know anything about the dungeon masters?" Ryan asked.

"No," Nakine replied. "However, I do know that they have been waiting for your friend. That massive hole appeared soon after the battle started, so I can only think that they went all out against her. I knew that this friend of yours was powerful, but an attack of that level I never heard off."

Great, now Ryan and Femradiel were looking for Alissa without knowing the enemies that almost killed her. It wasn't a good idea to approach the domain of elder gods without knowing a single thing about their abilities and nature. Still, it seemed that they didn't have any option right now.

"Well we better get going," Ryan said.

"Wait, we are going to help you," Nakine said.
