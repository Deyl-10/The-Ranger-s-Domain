Chapter 801: Doubts

Chapter 801: Doubts

It was hard to tell the time in that world, so everything was too colorful, and there was no night, but Ryan assumed that one ten hours had passed when he got the first million points. Without wasting any time, Ryan freed Femradiel. For a while, she looked at him blankly, but eventually, she reacted.

"Is this another illusion?" Femradiel asked.

"No," Ryan replied. "This is the last stage of Hypnos' dream world."

"You are the real Ryan?" Femradiel asked while frowning.

"Did you meet a fake Ryan before?" Ryan asked.

"I actually did, and he was as annoying as the real one," Femradiel said. "Anyway, prove that you are the real one."

"You have gotten fa" Ryan said and then stopped when he saw the murderous look in Femradiel's eyes. "Is that good enough?"

"No you could be another illusion based on my memories," Femradiel said.

"... This might take forever, so you can doubt my identity while we headed to Hypnos castle," Ryan said.

Once Femradiel returned, so did Ryan's draconic powers. He turned into a dragon, and then his speed increased, but he was passing the stages any time faster.

"It seems we can't just move along the road; we have to kill a certain number of monsters to proceed and fight others," Ryan said.

"Right" Femradiel said while looking at Ryan with dubious eyes.

"You are being weird again," Ryan said. "Did the fake me that you met before did anything?"

"He was a bit different, but still an ass," Femradiel replied.

"Anyway, if you think I am a fake as well, you can kill some monsters and then bring Alissa yourself," Ryan said. "Speaking of which, did you find Hypnos dungeon? I assume that you reached the third illusion."

"Yeah I reached the third illusion, but I was having a hard time destroying the dungeons since Hypnos was using them to create a domain barrier to protect his own dungeon," Femradiel crossed her arms and then said.

"I guess I won in that regard," Ryan said. "It took me five weeks, but I destroyed all the dungeons in the world," Ryan said. "Anyway, I thought you were the ones that voice mentioned, but I guess I was wrong Perhaps Yahiko and some others are about to face Hypnos Speaking of that, I seriously need to sleep for a while. Can you move us using an earth platform or something while you defeat the monsters as well?"

" Sure," Femradiel said.

"Those long pauses again" Ryan said and then sighed.

Regardless, Femradiel was back, so that was just a minor problem. Come to think of it, Ryan was pretty sure that it was amazing that he endured those hellish illusions for so long without becoming wary of some things like Femradiel.

Once Ryan relaxed, he completely fell asleep. In the end, he had no idea for how long he slept, but when Ryan woke up, he was feeling angry and thirsty. It wasn't like he didn't feel like that during the other illusions, but things were more intense this time than before. Regardless, when Ryan opened his arms, he also saw Alissa standing next to Femradiel

"For how long did I sleep?" Ryan frowned.

"Three whole days," Femradiel replied. "I guess all this, and you aren't an illusion created by Hypnos to mess with us. No, he is using this damn environment to do that."

Ryan looked around and saw themselves passing above some sort of swamp where poisonous trends were trying to attack them. They were pretty strong, but they certainly weren't the strongest of all monsters they had seen in the last year.

"I guess this journey will take a while "Alissa said.

Alissa seemed fine, but Ryan couldn't help but worry about her. Her ultimate goal was to bring back Orgar, and Ryan was pretty sure that she did have the chance to see him, at least during the two first illusions. As for the third one, Ryan could only hope that the situation didn't mess with her head still, considering her behavior, it didn't seem that wasn't the case. Alissa wouldn't let herself be controlled by anger again.

"Did you try to work together? Maybe the stages can be cleared faster if we work together," Ryan said.

"We tried," Femradiel replied. "However, no matter what, one of us has to kill ten thousand monsters of each species to reach the next area. This fucking game is so annoying"

"Really? Under different circumstances, I sure could enjoy this" Ryan said.

"I can't understand how," Femradiel said.

"Me neither. The idea of training in a place not bound by reality's time is appealing, though," Alissa said.

Since there wasn't much that they could do, they decided to make the most of the situation. If Hypnos wanted to see others playing that game, then Ryan would play it and then force Hypnos to regret that. Just like the dungeon shop, the things Ryan could buy using that system were based on how many coins he had. Still, it would take a while before he could find anything useful. So, he decided to create a decent stock of potions. Even the special potions that could boost attributes temporarily were being sold, but they cost one thousand potions. Still, Ryan couldn't help but wonder why he couldn't gain the monsters' essence this time.

"What do you think of this?" Alissa asked. "Why would Hypnos create an environment where he is waiting for us at the end, but we can get stronger along the way?"

"Obviously, Hypnos is gaining something from this," Femradiel said. "Probably energy and much more energy than he needs to use to keep this illusion active.
