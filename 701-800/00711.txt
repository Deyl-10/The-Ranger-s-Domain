Chapter 711: Death

Chapter 711: Death

Thanatos looked pretty pissed when he was forced to use his scythe to block Femradiel's attack, but he didn't change his attack pattern in the end. He just waited patiently for Ryan to run out of potions, just to prove how much superior he was in all aspects. In any case, Ryan decided to use Thanatos' plans against him, and he already had a few ideas on how to do that.

Suddenly, Thanatos felt something touching his left eye. The discomfort suddenly increased, and the discomfort turned into pain. When he used his left hand to check what happened, Thanatos felt his hand suffering some damage. That wasn't supposed to be possible. The enemy in front of him shouldn't be able to use near-instantaneous attacks. Could it be that Ryan kept that skill hidden despite the difficult fights he had to endure in the last few days? Once again, Thanatos was forced to reevaluate the threats that humans could be.

"Shit, this isn't causing much damage," Ryan said upon noticing just a few scratches on Thanatos' left hand.

He wasn't even bleeding even though Ryan used one hundred thousand coins in just a few seconds. It looked like Power of Money was similar to Thanatos' attack. Still, the difference in quality between them was like heaven and Earth, not to mention, Thanatos could cause direct damage without using a single point of mana.

"That attack doesn't have any divinity level on it, so it won't cause much damage," Femradiel said. "If only we could control that kind of energy it should be possible considering that he was worried about your sudden power up."

"Any ideas on how to do it?" Ryan asked.

"None," Femradiel replied.

"Then, don't bring up the possibility in the first place" Ryan said and then sighed.

It was a bit risky, but Ryan decided to use his next plan. He landed on the ground and then undid his transformation. Soon after, Ryan activated the skill: Plagiarism.

You successfully copied the skill: Death Manipulation Lv 19.

Cost: 5000 mana per second

Ryan didn't waste time and activated the skill, and by doing so, he forced Thanatos' to raise his hand and then block the wave of concentrated attack that Ryan fired at him. He used all his mana to do that since Ryan knew that he wouldn't have any other chance like that, but in the end, Thanatos felt the danger for his life and then blocked it. However, not even Thanatos was immune to his own skill. His left hand began to bleed profoundly, and he stared at it for quite a while. That gave Ryan the chance to recover some of his mana and even reuse Draconic Transformation.

Something in Thanatos' eyes changed after that attack. It looked like he didn't imagine Ryan would make him bleed at some point. Still, Ryan couldn't feel anger coming from him. That made Ryan frown. Considering that Thanatos played around for quite a lot until now, he imagined that any real damage caused would enrage him.

"How?" Thanatos asked. "Explain to me how you managed to copy my technique."

"I don't feel like it," Ryan replied.

That seemed like a waste of time. Why would Ryan explain the skill he obtained after clearing a tier two dungeon? It seemed that Thanatos wanted to mess with him in an odd way. Of course, he knew the skill that Ryan used. There was no real reason he wouldn't know. Still, the look of confusion in Thanatos' eyes made Ryan wonder if that was really an act.

"Where did you obtain such power?" Thanatos asked.

"Is this guy serious?" Ryan asked Femradiel.

"Weirdly enough, I think he is" Femradiel said. "He even stopped attacking you."

Ryan already knew that the elder gods weren't all-powerful. Still, it looked like their knowledge about the system was seriously lacking as well, even though they had been using it for thousands of years. Still, after considering that, Ryan couldn't help but wonder Do humans have access to certain features that they don't have? When one thinks about it, one can easily realize that the difference in power between elder gods and humans was massive. So, how come Ryan managed to defeat Poseidon, who had the opportunity to polish his skills for thousands of years? Lunar Arrow played a major role in that, just like Draconic Transformation, but were those enough to make a human defeat an elder god? Perhaps Ryan's ingenuity and persistence also played a major role, but not even himself was one hundred percent sure of it.

"No matter, once I kill you, I will turn into a zombie and then reaccess your memories," Thanatos said. "I will force you to give the answers I am looking for. Perhaps you don't know anything that I want, but perhaps you know and don't realize."

The atmosphere changed after Thanatos declared that. He disappeared from Ryan's field of vision and then appeared behind him. However, instead of attacking Ryan, he grabbed Femradiel by the neck.

"Let's get rid of this dirty worm first," Thanatos said.

Thanatos' proximity weakened Ryan and Femradiel's Mana Barrier, but Ryan turned around to counterattack despite that. Unfortunately, he wasn't fast enough, and Thanatos snapped her neck and threw her body aside like a ragtag doll. Something inside Ryan's snapped, and then his vision was covered by darkness. Thanatos also noticed that Ryan's presence changed, but Ryan's fists bashed him downward before he could react. Thanatos was caught off guard by the sudden increase of power and speed, but he couldn't have imagined that Ryan had just started and that he wasn't going to stop any time soon...
