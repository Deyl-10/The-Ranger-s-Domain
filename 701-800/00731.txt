Chapter 731: Another way

"You" Belphegor said while frowning.

"Me what?" Femradiel asked. "Just give me a minute to adjust to this body, it has a certain part that I am not used to having."

Femradiel was moving her shoulders, trying to get used to that body. It was more powerful than her old one, so such a thing was necessary. That was probably the first time she had full control over Ryan's body, so she was kind of excited to fight and mess around. Still, despite that, Femradiel couldn't help but frown since all the corruption disappeared once she obtained control over the body. It wasn't like it had disappeared for good, Femradiel could see Ryan's soul inside the body, and he was enveloped in a massive sphere of darkness. Weirdly enough, it was working like the shells of an egg, protecting Ryan's soul from any outside harm.

"Are you sure you can fight with a body that is exhausted?" Belphegor asked.

"Don't try to bullshit me," Femradiel said. "I know why you had to touch Ryan's forehead to make the skill work. This power of yours only works when you can access the enemy's mind. Since you were so eager to touch his head, I imagine that it is a specialized illusion spell that made him experience all the exhaustion he experienced during a few days instantly."

"Impressive analytical skills," Belphegor said and then sighed. " I suppose it can't be helped."

Weirdly enough, Belphegor touched his own forehead Femradiel frowned since she couldn't imagine him using the skill. He used to knock down Ryan on himself and then just give up. However, just like Belphegor could change the speed on himself and on his enemies as he sees fit, he also could do the inverse with that illusion spell. Femradiel concluded that once he saw a massive aura of energy overflowing from Belphegor's body thanks to that illusion spell, now he had a lot of energy available to him.

Belphegor dashed toward Femradiel, and even though Chronos' Ring, she failed at reacting on time and blocking his attack. A single kick on her stomach made her fall and hit the forest downward, causing a small earthquake. In the end, Femradiel finally noticed that the fight wouldn't end that easily.

"Fighting trying to conserve mana won't do me any good, even though I don't know if he has any other tricks up his sleeve," Femradiel thought as she was getting up. "Still, he already knows more or less what this body is capable of. I will have to improvise"

Belphegor flew toward Femradiel, but he stopped when several arrows suddenly appeared in front of him and then exploded. The power behind the Automatic Arrows was small, but that worked to surprise the enemy. Still, that gave Femradiel enough time to think of something.

When Belphegor confirmed that he was mostly unscathed, he tried to fly again, but then he was bombarded by water bolts. That caught him off guard since the damage was more impressive than expected, even though they were appearing so close to him and had no time to move.

Belphegor moved away from the barrage of attacks, but the bolts still appeared very close to him. When he looked at Femradiel, he noticed that she didn't move a single bit. However, she was holding a weird crossbow even though she couldn't properly use it due to the difference in size.

"... Let's hope that Ryan wasn't planning to keep this crossbow hidden for too long," Femradiel said while smiling nervously. "He never used this, after all."

In the end, Femradiel was forced to open Ryan's vault and grab a crossbow. She tried to use it alongside Magic Bow. Still, it didn't work probably because it was impossible to copy a weapon that had the soul of an elder god.

"Belphegor" Poseidon suddenly muttered. "A pathetic demon losing to a pair of pathetic worms."

"You lost to two pathetic worms, so what does that make you?" Femradiel asked.

Poseidon didn't have words to say. Still, it was weird that he didn't ask Belphegor to free him. Elder gods and demons really had a bad relationship Regardless, Femradiel was focused on attacking Belphegor. Still, even though her torrent of attacks was annoying, it definitely wouldn't kill someone of that level.

"I need a more definite way to cause real damage," Femradiel muttered.

Before Femradiel could come up with that way, Belphegor disappeared by using Teleport and then reappeared behind Femradiel. Another strike had been just enough for her to feel a massive wave of pain across the entire body, and she also heard the sound of her backbones cracking. However, this time, Belphegor didn't stop there. Before she could stop rolling on the ground, Belphegor kicked her again, this time on her face.

Without any other choice, since a third strike will definitely make her pass out, Femradiel used Light Solidification and fired small arrows of light on Belphegor's face. Once again, the demon was caught off guard when the arrows hit his face and began to burn it after blinding him for a few moments.

Femradiel used that opportunity to fire some bolts by using the Immobilizing Crossbow since Belphegor's speed was annoying. Thanks to it, not only did his speed decrease, but he also suffered a lot of damage. Belphegor looked at her, annoyed since she wasn't stopping since she activated Perfect Aim.

Belphegor teleported to high in the sky since he was already tired of that fight, and making it drag out would only make things more annoying.

"I can't destroy this world, so I can only use half of the energy," Belphegor said.

Belphegor pointed his hands toward the planer below him, and then he began to concentrate a massive amount of mana in the palm of his hands. Femradiel quickly found him, but before she could get close enough, she saw that the demon created a sphere of mana in a single second that was the size of a dragon.

"... oh, crap" Femradiel said.
