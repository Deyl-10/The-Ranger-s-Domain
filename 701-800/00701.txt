Chapter 701: Fallen Knight

Chapter 701: Fallen Knight

In the end, Ryan's guesses were wrong. He found fifteen dungeons inside the domain, but almost all the others granted Ryan classes that he already had or sacrificed aside from the first one. Fortunately, the last dungeon that Ryan and Femradiel cleaned granted them a class they never found before.

Congratulations! You have cleared the dungeon and obtained its treasure! As a reward for your achievement, you can obtain one of the three following classes: Fallen Knight, Sentinel, and Archmage.

Please be aware that clearing this dungeon again won't give you the chance to unlock the other remaining classes. If you want to obtain them, you will have to search for those in other dungeons.

Congratulations! You have become a Level one Fallen Knight!

"How unexpected that I would find this type of class here," Ryan rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Is it a coincidence?"

If monsters could be weak against holy magic, it wouldn't be weird that some others would be weak against dark or unholy magic. Still, Ryan couldn't help but wonder if it was a coincidence that a dungeon granted those skills could be found there. Perhaps he was overthinking. After all, vampires couldn't obtain other classes.

"I guess now we just need to summon more monsters and then look for the next dungeon," Ryan said and then turned to face Femradiel. "Hey, Femradiel, can you what? Why are you looking at me like that?"

"For no particular reason," Femradiel replied with a severe expression on her face.

"Can you look for another dungeon where we might find the path toward Thanatos' world?" Ryan asked.

"No," Femradiel replied.

" Why?" Ryan asked after a long sigh.

"I wonder why" Femradiel replied after she crossed her arms.

It was definitive, human hormones were affecting Femradiel's behavior. She was becoming even more complicated than ordinary female humans. At first, Ryan imagined that Femradiel's change in behavior was just on a whim to amuse herself, but it looked like that wasn't the case. Still, even though he didn't know the reasons, Ryan was deeply troubled.

"It seems you won't understand unless I say it clearly, so I will say it," Femradiel said. "Ryan, I like you."

" I don't dislike you either," Ryan said and then raised a brofist. "We are bros, right?"

"Oh, please" Femradiel said and then sighed again. "Don't you dare go off on the tangent."

"What? We are friends, right?" Ryan smiled since that was a pretty funny thing to do. "You are my best friend. It would be weird to say at this point in time that Furball is my best friend."

Ryan decided to stop joking around the very moment he saw that a vein was about to explode on Femradiel's forehead. He tried not to take things seriously, but now that was starting to annoy her too much.

"Let's not turn our partnership into something weird, Femradiel," Ryan said. "I mean, this is hardly the time since I am itching all over to kill Thanatos. Besides, you are my sister now, right? Or should it be my daughter?"

" What?" Femradiel asked with an astonished expression.

"You have my blood, so that makes us blood related, isn't that obvious?" Ryan asked.

"How in the hell would you conclude that?" Femradiel asked. "I only used your blood to obtain a human factor with this new body! There is not a single trace of your DNA on me!"

"Is that so" Ryan rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Well, not that it matters. Like I said, I can't spare a single thought on everything else right now. I will only focus on killing Thanatos."

"And after that?" Femradiel asked.

"After that, we can talk about what happened at Poseidon's castle and what made you change," Ryan replied. "Unless you give me a proper explanation of what happened there, I will only find your behavior suspicious. There you have it, if you want a proper answer about this issue, then you have to give me some as well."

"This issue this issue!" Femradiel said angrily.

Once again, Ryan confirmed that human hormones were affecting Femradiel too much. He could count with the fingers of a single hand the number of times she got mad, and from Ryan's perspective, that was hardly one reason to get that pissed. It seemed like their roles changed, and now he was the absolute cold dragon.

In any case, Femradiel realized that what Ryan said was right. First, they have to deal with Thanatos, and then she will have to explain what happened to Poseidon's castle. Sincerity can only come in both ways of a relationship. Still, for some reason, Ryan was almost sure that Femradiel wouldn't talk about it for quite a while
