Chapter 141: Missing The Old Days

Chapter 141: Missing the old days

As much convenient as it was, causing dungeon breaks was dangerous. It was only natural that Ryan wouldn't be able to use such an efficient method to grow stronger. Regardless, after finishing the monsters of the second dungeon break and getting his hands on his loot. Ryan decided to return to Shreveport since it was late, and he will have to waste sometime carrying everything he got on his improvised iron cart. As expected, it made a lot of noise, but Ryan didn't face any problems due to the monsters the noisy attracted.

"Who could have imagined that I would be able to progress this much by fighting slimes" Ryan frowned while checking his status. "That being said, it came with a cost"

Ryan obtained around one hundred status points thanks to the slimes, and he divided them between recovery, mana, and dexterity. Still, what really made his progress was the level-ups of his Archer class since each level up increased his status by fourteen points. While that was insanely useful and convenient, it was also quite scary... Ryan couldn't help but ponder if something weird won't happen considering that his body was getting stronger too fast.

Regardless, when Ryan returned to Shreveport, it was already pretty late. Still, despite his warnings, a massive bonfire was illuminating the area around the dungeon. If those idiots die or not, it was none of Ryan's business, but Ryan couldn't think the same if Arthur dies. In any case, Alissa was probably the one who made the bonfire, and since her presence could be felt from very far away by other dragons, then Shreveport was fine. Ryan found some lookouts before getting closer to the dungeon, but they recognized him and didn't make a fuss, even though he had no idea who they were.

There were several tents around the dungeon as well, more than enough to grant the chance to one hundred or so people to rest while others stay on guard duty. Much to Ryan's displeasure, Daniel was one of the people who was still working. For some reason, he looked pretty tired.

"Hey you finally returned," Daniel said. "Your friend is over there on Mia and Arthur's tent. I told her that the boss spawned one hour ago, but she ignored me."

Ryan sighed. He could understand that some people would need a break now and then with the world in that state, but Alissa wasn't normal, and she didn't need to rest as much as the others. In any case, she was enjoying too much looking after Arthur, and Ryan was afraid that she would ask something unreasonable pretty soon. She definitely was that kind of girl, after all.

"I got all this while I was cleaning a dungeon, and I also obtained some interesting pieces of information," Ryan said. "Do you want to buy them?"

"Sure, we can deal with this later when Tristan and Natalia wake up," Daniel said. "They are responsible for this kind of thing since they have some useful skills. Let's talk for a little bit meanwhile."

"I am not here to talk. I am here to do business," Ryan said, and then he headed toward Mia's tent.

When Ryan arrived there, he saw Arthur sleeping and Alissa looking at him. She looked pretty satisfied for some odd reason, as for Mia, who was on the opposite side of the tent, she looked exhausted.

"Why didn't you clear the dungeon yet?" Ryan asked. "Didn't you say you want to obtain some classes?"

"That can wait," Alissa said. "Besides, it is already late. We can do this tomorrow."

While that was a reasonable argument, it doesn't matter if it is late or not. Alissa could clear most dungeons in less than five minutes if she wants to. Still, while that was true, Alissa's body still wasn't that efficient at using draconic powers. So, he decided to leave her alone for the time being.

"When you intend to clear the dungeon?" Ryan asked. "There are others in this area. I want you to clear all of them tomorrow."

"Before breakfast is fine with you?" Alissa asked.

Ryan sighed. More and more, he was missing the days when he was working alone, and he didn't have to endure that bullshit. Regardless, Ryan was also a bit tired since the events of Las Vegas still were bothering him. So, he laid in a place where the grass wasn't that tall, and the warmth of the bonfire still could reach him while he rests. Unfortunately, Daniel had other plans. Ryan was too tired to be sarcastic, but in the end, Daniel deserved to hear some bullshit.
