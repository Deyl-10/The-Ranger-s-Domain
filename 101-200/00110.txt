Chapter 110: Unavoidable.

Chapter 110: Unavoidable.

The next day when Ryan woke up, he headed to the top of the mall only to find Alissa snoring loudly. He sighed. By some miracle, the demons didn't find her and destroyed the mall. However, it looked like that hadn't been the case. Even though she was sleeping, a Flame Arrow appeared right above and flew in a straight line. Ryan looked in that direction and saw the exact moment a flying demon exploded and died.

"I guess Orgar doesn't need to sleep much he is obviously the one who did that."

After a while, Alissa woke up confused. She didn't even notice that she falls asleep at some point, but she quickly fixed her posture and cleaned the drool out of her mouth.

"My bad," Alissa forced a smile and then scratched the back of her head.

"Don't apologize," Ryan said. "It was also my fault for leaving such an important job on the hands of someone so so Anyway, I guess we can reach the dungeon today."

"At least finish your sentence" Alissa sighed.

Although Orgar could cover for Alissa, that wasn't really the issue. She was trying to obtain power by her own merits, but it was clear that Alissa wasn't suited for several types of jobs. The chances of them challenging the boss that day were quite low, but even though Ryan wanted some time to prepare, he thought it would be best if they talk with the boss as early as possible since some serious problems might happen by camping near the dungeon.

"The chances of me finding a decent class there is pretty high as well since the demons are the strongest type of enemy, I found so far aside from the dragons."

After reading themselves, Ryan and Alissa headed to the dungeon. Since they were only a few kilometers away from it, they finally were forced to face another type of demonic creature.

"I guess at this point in time, it is pretty obvious that they become stronger when they become demons," Ryan frowned when he saw the black eyes of the giant bees. "Oh, well more coins for us."

Alissa was responsible for killing the slimes, and since she had to spend some time eating them, the job of attacking the bees was Ryan's. Although their endurance was low, the bees weren't as stupid as the flying demons. They could fly to the side the very moment they saw Ryan throwing his bone arrows and completely avoid them. It was annoying, but Ryan had to use the Flame Arrows to kill them.

"Since I can't learn new spells on my own, I might as well train the offensive ones that I already have."

Fortunately, even though the number of enemies had increased, Ryan and Alissa's movement speed didn't decrease since the previous day they got some room to breathe thanks to Ryan's new fighting style. Even if that weren't the case, it was fine since Ryan has been saving some status points. If things get harder, he can always use them. Fortunately, that never happened, and even better, they reached the dungeon, and there was a single sign of a dragon nearby.

"Something is off" Ryan frowned. "At this point in time, our presence here should have been noticed by the dragons. Some of them are fighting together, right? Why not a single one of them came to see you?"

" Probably because they think I disgraced the pride of our race by siding with a weak species."

That makes sense since Orgar was also pretty prideful. Still, that was a bit too convenient and Ryan didn't like that. It felt like an important piece of the puzzle was missing, and Ryan had no idea where he would find it.

"We still have some hours before sunset," Alissa said while looking at the sky. "What should we do? Rest and enter the dungeon tomorrow or attack right now? I am fine with either."

In any other situation, Ryan would have said to enter the dungeon and challenge the boss. He did that many times before, even when he had many doubts in his head. However, the situation was different, and coming up with an answer wasn't so simple when dragons were a part of the equation.

"You should enter now and clear it. Even if the boss is stronger than we had imagined, you should be able to defeat it with ease, even though that will be a bit mentally taxing. If they don't give the answers, we are looking for. We will go to the other side of the dungeon."

That had been the plan since the very beginning, but now that he thought about it, Ryan began to imagine what he would see on the other side a world of demons? A world of demons being invaded by monsters? Hell? Either way, all possibilities were quite scary.

"I wonder why I am getting nervous now I faced worse odds by fighting alone the red dragon, and this time I am not alone even though I plan to fight alone."

Regardless, Ryan was getting ahead of himself since they had to talk with the boss first and then fight if they don't find the answers they were looking for. Hell, Ryan was planning to fight the boss even if they give him the answer they want because there is no way in hell he would leave those creatures to roam around his home planet.
