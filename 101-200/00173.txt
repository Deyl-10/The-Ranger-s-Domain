Chapter 173: Unknown plans

That explained a lot of things although the city had been devastated by dragons and the other monsters were doing whatever they wanted in the streets, some individuals still could monitor things to a certain extent. One didn't have to be a genius to understand that someone close to the government was doing that. Only the government had the resources to do with the world in such a state.

" I don't know, really." The blond woman said nervously. "They just contacted us a few times and warned us not to move. Then, a few minutes ago, they said that it was fine to leave because help has finally arrived. However, if I had to make a bet"

"The white house, huh," Alissa said. "That would explain a lot. Still, why they didn't tell you guys to ask for help?"

"The answer is simple, whoever told them about you two, decided to use them and check if you were an enemy or an ally."

Again, that made a lot of sense Ryan didn't want to believe that the government had fallen so low to do that kind of thing. Then again, Ryan wouldn't be surprised if that had happened. He was betrayed by the woman he loved, so why not the country's leaders couldn't do the same?

"You guys can come with us if you don't slow us down," Alissa said. "However, we will only fight, food, water, clothes, whatever you need, you will have to find yourselves."

The blond woman and her companions didn't seem too keen on following Ryan and Alissa. By the look of things, they have been waiting for some knights in shining golden armor to rescue them with smiles on their faces. Still, all of them decided to follow the strangers since they had no idea if the situation was worse outside the city. Besides, now and then, they could hear the sounds of dragons flying over the city.

Despite her words, Alissa made sure to watch her pace. Still, that probably hasn't been necessary since, after a while, they found the new monsters they were going to fight: The Giant Ants. The survivors shrieked in fear when they those monsters that had the size of a large dog approaching. The ants not only have some sharp blades in the place of their arms, but their fangs also looked like some sharp scissors. However, they relaxed when Alissa killed the monsters in a single instant with her crossbows.

"How weird"

Alissa's behavior changed quite a bit, to the point where Ryan wondered if she was trying to make fun of him since her behavior seemed strangely familiar to Ryan. He wanted to be as efficient as possible while hunting, but now that he saw things from another perspective, it looked like that was the fighting style of people who wanted to look cool.

The giant ants were weak but fast. Still, their speed wasn't their sole weapon. Ryan and the others learned after they killed several of the monsters, and then another group digs on the ground as if their claws were a hot knife and the ground was butter.

"It is all right," Alissa declared. "They won't approach while they feel my presence."

Now all doubts inside Ryan's head disappeared. Alissa really was acting out of character for some reason in any case, the ants didn't approach them as expected, but Ryan didn't drop his guard.

"You can snipe them from here," Alissa said. "I will train these guys for a while."

While those were some good news, Ryan couldn't help but show disbelief at Alissa's words, to the point where he began to wonder if she ate something weird or if she hit her head somewhere. For Alissa of all persons to do that was really weird Still, Ryan didn't feel like asking about her intentions.

"The General was planning to train the survivors with the help of your friends, so I will give him a hand and make him owe me more than a few favors," Alissa said.

The survivors frowned when Alissa looked at them, and they flinched when she took magic weapons out of nowhere. However, they relaxed again when Alissa started to give them magic items and even tomes completely for free. It looked like Orgar wasn't joking around when he complained that Ryan was too harsh with her in any case, Ryan could only hope that she wasn't planning to do anything suspicious. Otherwise, Ryan will have to get involved with something messy. Hopefully, she wasn't planning to make them her 'allies' like Ryan. Still, for the first time, Ryan had no idea what she was plotting.
