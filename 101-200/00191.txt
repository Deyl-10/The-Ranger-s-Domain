Chapter 191: The Strength To Kick Some Asses

Chapter 191: The strength to kick some asses

Before leaving the base, Ryan checked Arthur by using Search. As expected, Alissa was with him. Apparently, her soldiers were also with her, but they were not foolish enough to cause a ruckus and make the kid cry.

After that, Ryan left the base and went straight to the golems' dungeon. Those creatures had a pretty sturdy body, so they will be the perfect test subjects. Somehow, even though the string broke when he attacks Lilith, the bow was back to normal when he used Repair, and durability was complete again. So, now that he knew that, Ryan doesn't have to hold back anymore.

Using the dragon bones, he created a perfect copy of his bone arrows. Although the system didn't recognize it as a weapon and showed its status, Ryan could tell that the projectile was much more powerful than the regular arrows he bow could produce. Not only were they heavier, but they also a much better balance.

Without a hint of hesitation, Ryan fired one of those at the middle of one of the golems' bodies. Although the soldiers guarding the area frowned when Ryan suddenly appeared, they didn't complain when Ryan did their job. They wanted to slack off a little. Regardless the impact caused a loud noise, and like Alissa's attacks, it made the golem explode into several pieces. When Ryan went to check the arrow, he noticed that the projectile only lost a little bit of its tip.

"I guess using powerful arrows can also increase my attack power and save the durability of my bow it would be perfect if you could turn this kind of arrow into a magic item with a specific effect."

Ryan did some tests and confirmed that he could repair those arrows, and each one of them could kill at least ten golems before they start to lose some piercing power. They will be useful when Ryan starts to hunt dragons, but their weight was a problem, and Ryan didn't have a quiver to store those long arrows. In the end, he could only carry around five of them.

"Well, if anything, they will be useful when I hit them alongside my hammer the bone arrows will resist the attacks and pierce the dragons' body even deeper."

The bones will be good arrows. The question was: what could the scales become? Defensive gear? Ryan certainly didn't have the skills to make them, and unless they give bonus statuses, it would be a waste to wear in the place of chainmail and breastplate. Although another single attack almost killed him, Ryan still wanted to make more weapons. However, this time, throwing knives would be the best option. Thanks to the fact that they were incredibly sharp, Ryan would be able to kill several small fries with them easily, and if he uses Wind Manipulation, things will be even more interesting since the scales weren't heavy.

"Although that seems interesting, the limit of their attack power and speed will always be related to me. Also, if I have to rely on mana all the time, it will be meaningless when a really tough enemy appears I guess making my own rapid-fire crossbow and make the bolts with the scales will be more useful."

Ryan always had some ores to use, so crafting a crossbow wasn't a problem. Besides, he could use such a weapon with a single hand, so that wasn't so bad. However, there were other problems. Without mana, the weapon won't be able to reload magically fast, and Ryan still will have to recover his bolts after using them... he would save time during fights, but he will have to waste some in between. In the end, wasting time was necessary to level up his skills, and even though that would consume his mana, fighting like that would make his skills level up so, it wasn't like wasting time.

"Yep, the answer to everything is recovery."

After deciding to keep the bones and scales of the dragon stored, for the time being, Ryan decided to head southeast this time. Based on the things he knew, Ryan had to keep hunting dragons for several reasons. The main reason was to strengthen himself and the second reason was to control the damage they might cause. Considering that they were fighting against the megalodons over dominance of the coast of the country, Ryan knew the perfect place to find both monsters: Miami.

"I don't think I can gain anything like dragon hearts by fighting megalodons, and I can't kill them unless they leave the ocean. Still, since they are tough opponents, my skills will level up fast. Besides, there are some big cities between here and there, and based on my experience, I am bound to found a few dungeons around those places."

Alone, Ryan will have to work hard to clear the dungeons that already broke and are about to break again. However, that itself was fine. He was expecting to return to the base in a few days. Ryan was determined to grind like there was no tomorrow for quite a while. Unless something happens, he won't stop until he gets the strength to kick some demons' asses.
