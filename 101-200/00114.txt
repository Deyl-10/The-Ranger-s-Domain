Chapter 114: Azure Edge

Chapter 114: Azure Edge

Although the variety on the dungeon shop was amazing, and by killing demons, Ryan would be able to obtain forty thousand coins every day, he didn't find anything at the same level as his flame sword. How could he? That was the item he received after killing a red dragon, after all.

"Maybe the dungeon shop will improve in the future, but I can't exactly wait for it," Ryan scratched the back of his head. "For that fighting style to work, I need several weapons with a decent durability, and that has different effects."

Ryan would need a way to create his own magic weapon, but doing that seemed impossible since he couldn't create a single Fireball. To make matters worse, Ryan didn't find a single tome that could help him with that. Confirming his theory that the dungeon shop could improve, he saw a few tomes that he hadn't seen before, but then again, he couldn't just wait for it.

"I guess the only way is to keep killing bosses and hope that they will drop something decent, at least for the time being," Ryan sighed. "Speaking of which, that demon didn't drop anything Considering that Alissa was the one who killed maybe her luck influenced that. Knowing how dragons can be prideful, her luck is probably low."

Although Ryan didn't get anything decent since he killed so many demons, the number of items they dropped increased. That was the downside of trying to work solo. He couldn't sell those items to others. He wasn't exactly solo anymore, but the last person who needed items was Alissa. Aside from new magic weapons, Ryan needed a magic bag, or whatever is the name of the thing that can store a crazy number of things. That way wouldn't just have to leave his loot behind. The problem was a magic item that could do that was supposed to be even more powerful than the ones he already wanted for his new fighting style.

"So many problems" Ryan sighed again.

After a few hours and before the sun could set, Alissa returned while humming. She seemed in a good mood. While that was fine and all, Ryan didn't want to ask what happened. It would be better if their relationship stays as neutral as possible. Besides, he still was thinking of how to solve his own problems.

"Hey, Ryan," Alissa said and then made a massive blue-edged sword appear out of nowhere. "I created this with Orgar's help."

Azure Edge (Ice) (+5)

Effect: It freezes the foe upon contact. The ice damage is equal to your intelligence + (400%) per second. Strength + 150, Endurance + 120

Durability: 150/150

Ryan froze due to the shock. Putting the fact that Alissa seemed like a little kid who found a new toy, the fact that she created something like that was insane. The effects, the bonus statuses even the fact that she took the sword from what seemed to be a storage dimension was amazing. It wasn't crazy to say that she had all the skills that Ryan wanted, or to be more specific, Orgar had. Still, it wasn't insane either to say that Ryan wanted the dragons' power for himself.

"How exactly did you make that?" Ryan asked.

"Well, you see," Alissa said with a large smile on her face. "I was hunting some megalodons to test my new skills, and this sword was dropped by one of them. Then, I used some high-level alchemist skills to seal their spirits in this. Orgar knew exactly what I had to do. I ended up forgetting to use the ones that I wanted because this is too amazing."

"Indeed" Ryan said while thinking about those high-level alchemist skills.

"Now, I will be able to fight while holding back my draconic powers," Alissa said while swinging around that massive sword. "Thus, I won't have to sleep so much after a single day of fighting."

Alissa still looked quite frail despite all the monsters that she was eating. Thanks to it, her swinging around a sword bigger than her was really weird. Having an existence like her nearby was really troublesome in some aspects, but at least her power was so far above Ryan's level that he would never feel satisfied with his current level. In that sense, she was really useful.

"Good, you can test that theory tomorrow morning," Ryan said. "I don't want to leave the guard duty to you again until we confirm that."

"I already confirmed that. I just killed a megalodon using only this sword," Alissa frowned. "Anyway, are you planning to go somewhere tomorrow morning?"

"More or less, but I will be back before the twenty-four hours pass," Ryan said.

Although he probably could kill his tamed beasts, Ryan didn't want to use the demons the test his new skills. He was fighting them as enemies, but even though they were vicious bastards, he couldn't go down another level in his decency and treat them like lab rats. Although he did something similar when he was throwing bone arrows, this time would be different since tame would bound them to his will probably.

In any case, Ryan spent the night thinking of how to solve his current problems, but unfortunately, not a single solution had been found. Although his decision-making speed was insane, his creativity was seriously lacking.
