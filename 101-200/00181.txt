Chapter 181: Not Good...

Chapter 181: Not good...

Even Alissa didn't have the nerve to complain about the help that she never asked. After all, those people were fighting to free their hometown from the monsters' clutches. Besides, thanks to them and Ryan's area of effect buffs, the tide of the battle turned in their favor. However, they still would have some more surprises that day.

"They are coming"

When they heard Orgar's voice, Alissa and Ryan finally noticed. Flying in the direction of the battle, they saw more than fifty demons. Even without using Appraisal, Ryan recognized them as the bosses that were spawned when the dungeon break occurred. Besides, unlike the ordinary succubus, those new monsters had wings, weapons, and they were also wearing pieces of armor that protect their vitals. The only thing that they had in common with the succubus is that they were all females. Ryan used Appraisal to confirm his suspicions, but he quite didn't believe in what he saw.

"Usintia, Charlith, Helova" Ryan bit his lips in annoyance. "They are all different demons. How can this be?"

To think that different demons could have the same purpose In any case, once again, Ryan felt that something was out of place. Just like before, he couldn't quite pinpoint what was wrong, but he noticed one thing. That weird feeling he only had when he saw several bosses in the same place. Regardless, before Ryan could think of why he felt that, Alissa transformed into her dragon form.

"I will deal with them," Alissa declared. "Don't let a single one of my soldiers die. If you do that, we can negotiate the terms of cooperation."

It looked like if Ryan succeeds in that, Alissa will decrease the time they will have to work together. While that wasn't so bad since that was a good reason to do it, Ryan didn't want to face those monsters He wanted to test his strength once more against powerful foes. Unfortunately, since he couldn't fly, Ryan couldn't join the battle. Alissa made sure to draw the bosses' attention and made them pursue her pretty fly in the sky, where his arrows couldn't reach. She was getting better at getting on his nerves... still, her awareness of the situation also improved.

"I guess she really doesn't want to lose a single one of her soldiers"

Ryan also didn't feel like letting humans fighting so hard die. It wasn't his style, but he began to offer support to all of the survivors by attacking those who were having a hard time against the succubus. However, instead of using his bow or magic projectiles, he used his magic weapons. A single scratch of his spear was enough to make the succubus get paralyzed for a second, while the sword could burn the monsters and make them scream in agony. After that, they would become easy targets for the survivors. However,

"Crap this isn't enough"

Ryan was focusing on speed, but even so, slowly but certainly, the survivors were losing the fight against those massive numbers. If he couldn't kill the monsters, Ryan couldn't recover mana fast enough. If he kills the monsters, Ryan will spend more time and thus won't be able to help those who are needed.

"Hey, you!" Ryan shouted. "Pick that spear on your right! Pay more attention to the drops, dumbass!"

Without any other choice, Ryan was forced to shout and give those commands. Although some survivors got geared up and thus decreased Ryan's workload, things weren't looking good. Some survivors began to faint due to exhaustion. It was only natural since they were only ordinary survivors less than a week ago. Still, Ryan didn't feel like spoiling them due to that.

Suddenly, something fell from the sky and then hit a good number of the succubus, killing them instantly. Since the size was small, Ryan concluded that it was one boss that Alissa had defeated and thrown down in order to help the battle. However, much to Ryan's despair, the boss began to levitate, even though all the bones of her limbs were broken.

"That idiot at least finish them off before using them as projectiles," Ryan clicked his tongue in annoyance.

Ryan decided to finish the creature off as fast as possible, but before he could attack, the blood of the creatures that just died began to move toward the demon. In a matter of seconds after absorbing all that blood, the demon was back to normal. As if things weren't bad enough, the demon who was about to fly and join the others in the battle against Alissa stopped and then began to look directly at Ryan. It looked like the succubus found her new target.

"Not good" Ryan said. "Things are about to go downhill..."
