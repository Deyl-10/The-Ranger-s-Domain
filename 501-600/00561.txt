Chapter 561: Rage

Chapter 561: Rage

While Gustavo's friends showed some concern for the change in their actions again, none of them openly opposed the idea. Usually, Bianca would be the one to complain first. Still, since she was too quiet, everyone understood that she also was thinking along those lines. It was a necessary risk.

"Yesterday, things proceeded well with that formation. I am sure that today won't be different," Gustavo said. "Just in case things might become a bit more difficult than usual, let's use some buff potions before the fights while Ryan and Fernanda slow down the enemies."

Since things might become a bit messier, Ryan will have to keep Clairvoyance active as much as possible, but that much was fine with him since he could use Brazilians' potions without restraint.

After moving a few kilometers away from the Brazilian coast, everyone noticed a few changes. Pretty much every one or two kilometers they advanced, they found a party of at least six Hydras. When the fight prolonged for a while, others would join and make the fight last even longer to the point where the frontline members started to get tired and suffer some annoying wounds.

"Damn, at this rate, we will never reach that storm," Gustavo cursed and then said.

It was rare for Gustavo to lose his cool. Still, it was understandable since he also noticed that he was getting too relaxed and forgot about the real goal of that mission. He also realized that what Ryan said earlier was true. They would need some defensive gear in order to win that war of attrition.

"Mmm? Is that true?" Gustavo frowned.

Ryan frowned as well since he didn't hear anything, but then he realized that Gustavo was talking with the dragon inside him. Gustavo's expression lightened since he apparently heard something good. Suddenly, everyone also started to mumble with themselves, Ryan felt left out. Still, since he wasn't that interested in the dragons inside Gustavo and the others, he just waited patiently.

"Inoctis said that we should use Rage. That should help us a lot in the fights," Gustavo said.

"Is that so? Good for you, but that skill is completely useless for me," Ryan said.

"While that skill is convenient since it will boost our physical status, it will dull our sense, and we might get out of control," Gustavo said. "So, we will need you two to cover us even more than before."

"I didn't think that skill was that complicated," Ryan frowned.

"You are cool-headed, so you didn't use that skill all that much, but we did it," Gustavo said. "The higher the level of the skill, the more clouded our judgment becomes. It is a side effect of suddenly losing a lot of intelligence, mentality, and willpower. That skill is even more troublesome when we use Draconic Transformation because dragons are easily influenceable for negative emotions."

That made sense. Now that Ryan thought about it, Yahiko said that Ryan didn't smell much like dragons, and dragons smelled like the seven deadly sins. Wrath was one of the most dangerous sins, after all. Considering that, Ryan couldn't help but think if there were other skills related to the deadly sins. While he was hot-headed enough, Ryan could keep his anger in check. If there were some other skills related to the deadly sins, Ryan needed them to further increase his power.

Once the next fight started, Gustavo, Carlos, Paulo, and Bianca immediately activated Rage. Ryan saw their physical attributes increasing by seventeen percent, and their magical status decreased by the same amount. However, the first thing they did instead of attacking the Hydras was to roar roar underwater. Despite that, the entire area trembled, to the point where even the Hydras hesitated.

Those four used that chance to charge and attack the Hydras. Much to Ryan's surprise, they quickly surpassed the monsters' defense, but then it finally happened. Instead of aiming at the monster's vitals. Gustavo had an excellent idea to behead the beast. Naturally, his sword caused a lot of damage, but not enough to chop it off in a single swing. Eventually, he succeeded, but then as the head fell to the bottom of the ocean, others appeared.

"Great" Ryan thought.

Fortunately, the others weren't as hot-headed as Gustavo. So, they didn't try to behead the monsters. They only tried to make Sushi out of them.

"Can you keep the two-headed monster busy?" Fernanda asked. "A good electric spear will calm down, Gustavo."

"Right," Ryan said and then teleported to behind the monster.

Ryan grabbed the monster's tail and then used Teleport again and appeared several kilometers above sea level. Before the creature could fall, Ryan activated the fly and then began to spin while holding the monster's tail. It was a bit risky, but Ryan kept spinning the beast for several minutes until his arms got tired of it, but at least he confirmed what he wanted.

"Good, those fuckers can't use magic while they are dizzy," Ryan said while he was fighting against the dizziness as well.

While Ryan wanted to send the monster go from that distance, he wasn't confident in his brute strength. So, he teleported again to a point where he could barely feel gravity and finally let the monster go to space. It took a few seconds for the monster to freeze to death, but eventually, Ryan received his notification.

You obtained 8.000 coins.

"I guess absurd recovery won't prevent me from freezing to death" Ryan said while he was watching the Hydra moving away from Earth. "I need to be extra careful. All these powers and skills only made me a bit stronger than before. My mortality is as strong as ever."

After Ryan returned, he saw Gustavo offering support for the others alongside Fernanda, and he seemed pretty down. Probably because he lost his cool as expected, he seemed too good-natured to be true. Gustavo had his own demons like everyone else.

"I guess I am not ready for that skill again," Gustavo forced a smile. "Well, fortunately, those three won't see me as a target, even amidst their rage."
