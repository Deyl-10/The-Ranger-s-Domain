Chapter 522: Triton

Chapter 522: Triton

Even though her senses were pretty good, it took Femradiel a while to find a tier-three dungeon. The dungeon was located hundreds of kilometers away from the coast, so when they found it, it was already dark.

"I can pinpoint the location of some monsters below us, but you won't be able to use Appraisal on them, right?" Femradiel asked. "You need a clear view of them for the skill to work and in this type of situation, it won't happen."

"Indeed," Ryan said and then rubbed his chin thoughtfully." Still, I feel like leaving now would be a waste of time. I want to train Lunar Arrow whenever I have the chance, after all."

Attacking the monsters was possible, and Lunar Arrow probably won't lose any power since it isn't a physical projectile, so the chances of Ryan killing the tier three monsters in a single shot were pretty high. However, doing so without knowing about their skills and attributes was just too reckless, even for Ryan's standards.

After thinking for a while, Ryan decided that he will have to take his chances to obtain the Intel that he wanted. Fortunately, he wasn't alone, so he could decrease the level of danger by relying on Femradiel.

"Femradiel, you will use Teleport and make me get close to the nearest enemy that is alone," Ryan declared. "After that, I will do the rest of the job."

"If you say so," Femradiel said. "Let's hope you mess by entering a range you aren't using at fighting."

Without giving a proper warning, Femradiel just teleported Ryan underwater. Since the monster wasn't far away from the surface, Ryan didn't feel weird by suddenly appearing below sea level.

In front of him, Ryan found another creature that had a light blue body. However, that one closely resembled a real fish. The beast had light blue and yellow scales covering some parts of its body. Instead of ears, the monster had fins. At the same time, the upper layer of the body was humanoid, but the lower layer was like the one which belonged to a fish. As expected, as if that was a standard weapon for the warriors of the oceans, the creature had a trident.

Ryan was caught off guard, given that the monster was even more powerful than the Azure Seahorses. However, the very moment the creature swung its spear, Ryan used Lunar Arrow. At lightning speed, the projectile fell from the sky and hit the monster's back, damaging its spinal cord. At least Ryan thought that had happened. He had no idea if monsters actually have a spinal cord.

Although the creature's status was pretty impressive, a single attack on its back had been enough to paralyze the beast. Ryan easily avoided the attack and then grabbed the monster's body and left the ocean by using Teleport since other monsters were around. He couldn't let them notice his presence.

"It looks like their vision isn't that amazing at night" Ryan frowned while looking at the paralyzed monster that still was alive. "Hey, Femradiel, can you read his mind and find some useful information?"

"I can only see what he is thinking right now," Femradiel replied. "But even if I ask some questions, we won't obtain any decent Intel since he is just an ordinary monster. You will need a boss for that."

That made sense. In the end, before the monster could recover from the damage, Ryan beat the crap out of the creature and then used Seal on the monster's body and then transferred his spirit to a crossbow.

Aquatic Hunter Crossbow

Effect: it passively increases the power of your attacks by one point for every minute you stay underwater. The bonus damage disappears once you leave the ocean. Each bolt costs 50 points of mana.

Dexterity + 130, Intelligence + 90

Durability: 100/100

"Nice, another interesting weapon for my arsenal," Ryan nodded to himself in satisfaction and then teleported the Triton's body in the distance. "The bonus will increase exponentially while I upgrade the weapon, so I should do it before I challenge the boss."

"You really like to create new weapons, huh," Femradiel said. "I guess everyone needs a hobby, but yours is quite weird."

"You are in no position to say that, I know that dragons love to guard and increase their treasure," Ryan said.

"I am more practical than mist dragons, if it isn't useful to me in the short and medium term, I don't consider most things a treasure," Femradiel said. "Still, this habit of yours is making me change my mind a little bit."

It was only natural since Femradiel already knew how useful a huge set of crossbows could be useful when used alongside the Magic Bow skill. That being said, the cost of mana of all weapons Ryan had in store was quite something.

In any case, now that Ryan had an idea of what he was going to face next, he could adapt his plans. First of all, he decided to upgrade his newest crossbow up to plus eight since that was the limit of the skill. To make sure that would proceed as smoothly as possible, Ryan used the same strategy to capture the Tritons. As expected, it took a while for Ryan to find the perfect conditions, but he succeeded in achieving his goal in the end.
