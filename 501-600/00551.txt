Chapter 551: Preparations

Chapter 551: Preparations

Although Ryan knew that Mia and Zoe could protect themselves in tier two dungeons, he decided to stay behind in order to make sure that things wouldn't get out of hand. Trusting Alissa too much wasn't a good idea since she was too wild, so Ryan spent his days creating potions and increasing the types of potions he could make.

Based on Ryan's estimations, when the Alchemy skill reaches level one hundred, Ryan will be able to make potions that boost all status. Knowing that Ryan couldn't help but wonder: what will happen if he continues to level up the skill while using Draconic Transformation?

"That is certainly something I look forward to," Ryan muttered to himself. "I only need to do something about my pride."

While Ryan was thinking about that, he saw Mia, Zoe, and Arthur leaving the dungeon. Ryan decided to use Appraisal on the kid, only to see that Arthur had already more than three classes. As if that wasn't enough, all of his statuses were pretty high for a kid of his age. To the point where he could cause a lot of destruction if he were to try some mischief. Despite that, it didn't look like Mia and Alissa had problems with that.

"I suppose they concluded it would be good for him to have some classes, at least from the dungeons that can be easily cleared," Ryan nodded to himself. "While they probably won't let Arthur join the fights anytime soon, it will only become harder to obtain more classes and skills in the future."

Ryan considered the possibility of using the Teacher class and teaching Arthur some skills, but others probably did that. Besides, Ryan didn't want to grow overly attached to the kid. Most of his thoughts considered his and Zoe's safety, after all, and Ryan certainly didn't want to think more about them.

"I forgot to mention it, Ryan," Alissa said in her draconic form while she was blocking Femradiel's Ice Spears in her Ice Phoenix form. "I obtained two of those special classes. They were pretty awesome."

"Is that so" Ryan said. "As you already know, I don't accept thanks, only coins."

"Actually, I wanted to exchange information with you about those classes," Alissa said. "That way, we will learn the right classes to sacrifice, and them obtain the classes and skills we want."

That was interesting and a pretty good idea. So, Ryan couldn't help but think why he didn't consider that before probably because few people could reach at that level of progress in a few months. Besides, even fewer people would feel compelled to exchange such valuable pieces of information.

Without making much of a fuss, Ryan told Alissa the classes he sacrificed to obtain Artemis' Disciple class. Although he didn't think it would be much useful to her, he also told her about the ones he used to obtain Frozen Spellcaster.

"Somehow, I don't feel like learning Lunar Arrow. That skill kinds of traumatized me," Alissa said. "Anyway, by sacrificing the classes Knight, Sorcerer, and Priest, I obtained the Valkyrie class. Also, by sacrificing Combat Ranger, Thief, and Demon Hunter, I obtained the Demonic Trapsmith class. My two classes are cooler, so I win."

Ryan had no idea what Alissa was trying to win, but he couldn't say that she was wrong. After she explained the skills she got, Ryan truly believed that she had won in all sense. With Valkyrie class, she could buff a large-sized army and even prevent deaths while leading the attacks. The Demonic Trapsmith class could do exactly that, trap demons. However, the skills only worked in demons much weaker than Alissa. She thinks that she will be able to seal a high-leveled demon in a trap in the future. Still, Ryan wasn't so sure about that.

"I am pretty sure only women can become Valkyries, so I don't think this piece of information will be that useful," Ryan said.

In the end, Alissa kicked Femradiel's ass for a while, but then she decided to stop since it was getting late, and she was smart enough to understand that things might become problematic if she doesn't return Mia, Zoe, and Arthur to the dungeon as soon as possible.

"I guess it is time to go," Alissa said. "Next time, I will bring my guys to clear the new dungeons, and then we will train again. Look forward to having your ass kicked nicely."

"Bye, big bro," Zoe said.

Ryan hesitated in saying anything, but at least he managed to wave his right hand. Mia also hesitated in saying anything, but since Ryan didn't have been that difficult, she mustered her courage.

"Until next time, Ryan," Mia said.

"Yeah," Ryan nodded.

Alissa and the others soon disappeared in the distance since she had put some type of high movement speed spell somewhere around. Things finally got quiet again, and Ryan sighed in relief. Despite that, he felt slightly troubled due to a weird feeling inside him. It was annoying to admit, but Ryan felt refreshed since he truly managed to forget about fighting for an entire day.

"I can't relax even for a second, huh," Ryan said and then sighed. "Hey, Femradiel. What are you going to do now? Keep another dungeon in check?"

"That was the idea. The Banshee's dungeon already is causing a lot of problems," Femradiel said. "That being said, my Wyrm and Drake form already are powerful enough to be of some assistance to you, so we can leave those two dungeons in the hands of your golems if the necessity arises."

"Ryan," Gustavo said via telepathy. "We are planning to attack the Hydra's dungeon. Are you going to help us?"

It looked like Ryan was going to face some action again, but in the ocean, Femradiel wouldn't be of any help.
