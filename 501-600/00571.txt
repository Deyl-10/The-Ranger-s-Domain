Chapter 571: Chimeras

Chapter 571: Chimeras

Like most cities in the world, Cairo had been completely destroyed by the attack of dragons. However, almost the entire city had been recovered after four months since many humans joined Isis's camp. While her dungeon was a pyramid located in the center of the city and was the most impressive building, the other places weren't half bad. Houses, restaurants, shops specialized in dismantling monsters and things like that could easily be found in the city. Not only most of the city that had been recovered but it was also protected by some crazy walls that were fifty meters tall and twenty meters thick.

While they were crossing the city gates, Ryan saw the tanned man taking off his helmet, and Ryan saw a bearded man that was probably in his thirties. His face had some scars due to the battles of the last seven months, but somehow Ryan could feel a youthful feeling coming from him. On the other hand, the beard was probably making him look older, and Ryan couldn't help but wonder how someone could keep such a thick beard in that hellish weather.

"My name is Mohammed," The tanned, bearded man said.

"You already know my name, and this noisy chicken here is Femradiel," Ryan said.

" You called me what?" Femradiel asked, and she looked pretty angry for a change of pace.

Ryan ignored Femradiel and waited for Mohammed to keep talking, but the man just looked at him as if he was waiting for something as well. Things stayed silent for quite a while since Ryan was used to silence.

"Are you really human?" Mohammed asked.

"What makes you think that I am not human?" Ryan frowned.

"All foreigners that I talked to until now always mention how my name is so common" Mohammed replied.

"Well, I am pretty sure the people you talked with before came to your country as tourists who wanted to have a fun time," Ryan said. "Like I said before, I don't have much free time, and I have come to help, not to make fun of anyone's name."

"All right then," Mohammed said. "I believe that to help you understand the situation we are in, you should listen to the things we experienced since the dungeons appeared."

"As long as that tale doesn't take too much time, I don't mind," Ryan said while he looked at some shops selling potions.

"When the monsters arrived, we had to see our very civilization being destroyed alongside most of the people that we knew," Mohammed said. "Those who managed to hide soon had to deal with other problems when the dragons leftlack of water, food, and the arrival of weaker monsters. However, Lady Isis's servants protected us. They then guided us to her dungeon, and there she taught us about the system and how we could protect ourselves."

"And she didn't ask anything in exchange," Ryan said.

"She said that the Egyptians' children were her children, so that much was the least she could do to her people," Mohammed said. "While she indeed offered us the alternative to rebuilding our society under her rule, she didn't force us to do anything. If that is what you are thinking."

"Whatever you say, mate," Ryan shrugged.

"After pledging loyalty to her, we managed to increase in numbers after we rescued others, survivors," Mohammed said. "However, some of our bases were attacked and taken by some species of monsters. At first, there were only the Brute Feralligators. Still, then the weather began to worsen, and then the Magma Golems appeared and joined them. We managed to withstand even those two groups, but then when another army of monsters joined their side, we began to lose this war."

"What is the third type of monster?" Ryan asked.

"The Chimeras" Mohammed replied. "They are troublesome enough by themselves to the point where I can't help but think that only that group will be able to wipe us out now that their forces surpassed the level of Lady Isis's forces."

Chimeras Ryan could imagine them but couldn't imagine why he only saw the armored alligators that day. That was weird, given that Mohammed said three species of monsters were fighting against them. In any case, solving that problem might be a bit more complicated than Ryan thought decimating the three armies wouldn't solve the problem only defeating the three dungeon masters.

" Why aren't the monsters working together?" Ryan asked while he massaged his eyebrows.

"We don't know the exact reason. We assumed that they could attack us many times in a single day in order to wear down our troops," Mohammed explained. "However, we don't see them working together in order areas as well."

While the dungeon masters certainly were working together to defeat Isis, who was a tougher foe, they weren't that friendly toward each other. Maybe Ryan could exploit that

"So, you are having a hard time being attacked on three fronts?" Ryan asked. "Well, you should just focus on defense. I will do something about defense."

"Things aren't that simple," Mohammed said. "Now and then, some troublesome individuals appear, and the fights become even more chaotic, and our losses increase significantly."

"Who are they?' Ryan frowned.

"Human Chimeras humans who joined the other side in exchange for power," Mohammed said. "When they appear, our morale drops significantly to the point where most of us freeze in fear."

"Why?" Ryan asked.

"You will see when you find one of them," Mohammed said.

Ryan didn't like all that drama and mystery, but in the end, he decided to rely on his eye to judge that. Regardless to think that even humans could become chimeras while Ryan didn't have much respect for some dungeon masters, he at least hoped that some of them had a code of honor like Isis. Still, it looked like that had been only his nave thinking making him see some of his enemies as semi-reasonable individuals. In any case, before the next battle, Ryan had a place where he had to go: Isis's dungeon.
