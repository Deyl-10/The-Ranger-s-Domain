Chapter 569: Support

Chapter 569: Support

After hearing Isis's offer, Ryan readily accepted, but before heading to Egypt, he returned to his domain to talk with Femradiel. One of the familiars certainly will come in handy in that mission, and since she said that she was bored due to the fact that the fights were too easy, she certainly would agree to come. However, after hearing Ryan's explanation, Femradiel was more interested in something else.

"You really went and asked for help, huh," Femradiel said. "I could swear that you would give up at the last moment."

"The image you have of me is that bad anyway. Are you coming or not?" Ryan asked.

"Yep, I can help you," Femradiel said. "My Wyrm and Drake form is powerful enough to guard two of those dungeons each, so the Ice Phoenix will offer you some support."

While Ryan couldn't imagine how that familiarity at that level would be useful, Ryan knew that Femradiel could show a power beyond the limits of status and skills. Time was of the essence, so Ryan headed toward his destination. Fortunately, Isis put his dungeon near Egypt's capital, the city of Cairo. So, finding it would be easy. Even if that weren't the case, Femradiel's tracking skills would come in handy.

Since Ryan went in a straight line, he had the chance to see almost the entire northern part of Africa's coast. While he didn't see a single survivor's camp, near the ocean, he saw countless monsters facing each other on the beaches. Monsters were coming from the sea-facing the monsters coming from the mand. The strongest monster he found there was the Magma Golem.

"Damn, this place is hot" Femradiel said. "You should have warned me of this weather."

"You can use magic to refresh yourself, so stop complaining," Ryan said. "That being said, being this close to the Equator line surely is tough"

"I don't know where you are looking. The heat is coming from the continent," Femradiel said.

"For some reason, I feel many presence of fire creatures in that direction. Even the dungeons emit that kind of energy."

It looked like Ryan had some things to investigate in the African continent. It was a pity that he didn't have that much free time.

One hour before sunset, Ryan arrived in Egypt. It was hard to be sure if the image he had of that country based on some movies was accurate or if the monsters' arrival also changed the county's environment. Still, Ryan couldn't see anything in the distance aside from a massive desert.

Congratulations! The skill Heat Resistance has leveled up.

You obtained 01 status points.

"Well, it looks like the monsters' arrival certainly made things hotter in here," Ryan frowned.

"Femradiel, can you tell me how many tier three dungeons are in that direction."

"Two, I assume that is where we are going, huh," Femradiel said, and then she landed on Ryan's head since the weather really got her.

While it was a bit annoying to let Femradiel stay there, at least her claws weren't that sharp, and her body temperature was perfect. For the time being, Femradiel would work just fine as a portable AC.

Although Ryan wanted to see with more detail the situation in the country, he decided to move to his destination as fast as possible with Teleport, instead of using Fly. Isis alerted her followers about Ryan's arrival, but he wouldn't be that easily identifiable at night. After a couple of minutes, Ryan and Femradiel found Egypt's capital, alongside two armies of monsters that were fighting against each other. Aside from that, Ryan could also see the tier three dungeon inside the city, and the enemies' army was just a couple of kilometers away from it. Due to that, using an illusory barrier was probably useless since the fights would make things too obvious.

In any case, maybe it was a coincidence, but the dungeon inside the city was located inside a massive building that had the shape of a pyramid. From the left side of the battlefield, Ryan saw the cat-like monsters again. Isis sure likes them. In any case, their level was around 650 it looked like that was the place Isis was using to make her return.

As for the right side, Ryan saw some weird-looking crocodiles covered in armor and armed with cutlasses. They kind of reminded Ryan of the Reptilians, but they looked much more fearsome. Another surprising thing about them was the fact that they used two swords.

When Ryan used Appraisal, he understood why Isis's minions were losing that war. Even Ryan kind of hated enemies that were focused on endurance and survivability since they took too long to kill. Regardless, at the same time, he would have a long time to level up his classes.
