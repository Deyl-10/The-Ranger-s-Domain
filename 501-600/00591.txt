Chapter 591: Too Good

Chapter 591: Too good

After returning to Earth, Ryan and Femradiel saw Mohammed and the others finishing off a magma golem. Despite the presence of the monster, Ryan couldn't feel that much heat. After using Clairvoyance, Ryan confirmed that the sun had already set, and that explained the cold ambient.

"Did you succeed?" Mohammed asked.

"I wouldn't be here if that weren't the case, "Ryan replied. "Anyway, why are you here? Shouldn't you be guarding the Chimeras' dungeon?"

"I wanted to confirm personally if you would return or not," Mohammed said. "Regardless, I also forgot to thank you for your help until now."

"Thanks are unnecessary, I am being paid for this work," Ryan said. "Anyway, onto the next dungeon."

Mohammed tried to offer an alternative since Ryan and Femradiel looked pretty beat up. Still, before he could say anything, they disappeared. Ryan and Femradiel suddenly appeared in the cold desert of the night, but then Ryan stopped.

"You can rest here, for a while," Ryan said. "I should be able to defeat the next dungeon master alone."

"There is nothing to do here, besides, I don't think we will find another hellish environment," Femradiel said.

"You wouldn't know," Ryan shrugged. "Well, don't complain later."

"Why are you confident this time?" Femradiel asked. "If I remember correctly, you also sounded pretty confident before the previous fight. I wouldn't lose for nothing in the world the chance to see you getting annoyed after saying something like that."

Ryan sighed. Femradiel only talked with Alissa a few times, but it looked like she copied some of her traits. The worst ones at that. In any case, despite the fact that Ryan's tiredness was building up, he teleported to the next dungeon. He then touched the purple crystal before anyone could see him.

In the end, Ryan and Femradiel appeared in a place just like he had imagined: a very dense forest. However, he didn't have time to check the environment properly because Ryan felt several presences. He also felt the danger to his life.

Ryan immediately used Teleport and appeared hundreds of meters above. At the place he had been a moment ago, several spears pierced the ground. It looked like that was the way of the locals to say welcome. Before Ryan could attack the creatures, they were teleported to another location.

"Great another fucker that keeps attacking with their troops like that," Ryan sighed and then said. "This might take a while."

"I don't think so," Femradiel said. "The level of mana in this world is quite stable, so I can sense where the crystal is."

"That seems too good to be true" Ryan said. "At this point in time, all dungeon masters should know a few tricks to hide their treasure. That being said, the crystal can't be used until the dungeon master is defeated."

"What are we going to do?" Femradiel asked. "Let's move toward the crystal in a calm manner, there is no need to rush and fall into an obvious trap."

Although he still was in a hurry, by being cautious now, Ryan probably will save a lot of time later. The last time he hurried without thinking, he ended up locked in a magic barrier that prevented him from using active skills and spells, after all.

While that forest didn't have massive trees like the ones he found in the goblins' world, those were pretty tall as well, but the grass wasn't tall enough to cover an adult human male. Still, Ryan felt pretty uncomfortable since the forest was too quiet. Aside from the sound of the wind, Ryan couldn't hear animals, or even insects. That was odd. Such a green forest was supposed to be full of life. Then again, that was an alien planet, so Ryan couldn't use his lacking knowledge of biology to ponder about such a thing.

Based on what he knew, Ryan assumed he would be safe flying high since the armored crocodiles certainly were the favorite species of that dungeon master. From above the forest, Ryan confirmed that the place had no signs of battles. It was hard to know if that was good or bad for Ryan.

In the end, Ryan truly didn't suffer any ambush, and after flying for half an hour, he managed to see the first and perhaps the only building in that world. It was a fortress, a pretty large fortress that was even higher than the fifty-meter tall trees. While the building was covered in vines, Ryan could see that the place was in perfect condition, even from a distance. Aside from that, he also could see some heads trying to check the surroundings through the windows of the building.

"I guess those are the ones who usually stay behind to guard the fortress," Ryan said. "There is no doubt, the dungeon master here is using copies of his people to fight. The bosses probably are the strongest soldiers here."

"While they are also archers, it seems their eyes aren't as good as yours," Femradiel said. "They obviously didn't notice you yet."

"It doesn't matter, the dungeon master will warn them once I am close enough," Ryan said. "Not that I need to get closer than this."

Ryan's range was equal to the distance he could see with his eyes, so he could attack the fortress. However, his goal was to defeat the dungeon master and their minions. The enemy could easily save their troops by teleporting them around or, even worse, scattering them around to make Ryan's life harder.
