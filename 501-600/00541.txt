Chapter 541: Surprise

Chapter 541: Surprise

Ryan tried to identify the real boss by using Radar, but much to his surprise. The skill showed him that all of them were real. That wasn't supposed to be possible, and yet, Radar never failed before.

Unfortunately, before Ryan could think of any way to solve that mess, the boss attacked him by firing some Fireballs. That was a spell that he didn't see any boss using in quite a while, but that didn't matter since all the copies also attacked using the same skill. There wasn't any place Ryan could escape, so in the end, Ryan used Mana Shield to block the attacks and confirm what he learned previously. Every time the shield was hit, his mana decreased.

"Hey seriously?" Ryan's mouth was hanging open due to the surprise.

It was not surprising that hundreds of those projectiles could cause so much damage. Besides, Ryan was pretty sure that the skill the monster had was at least at level two hundred or something. However, using such an attack so many times wasn't wise. Even bosses were bound to run out of mana if they kept firing so many spells.

Ryan decided to use some potions and see for how long the boss could keep attacking like that. Still, in the end, after a full minute, Ryan understood that the boss wasn't joking. He truly intended to keep firing hundreds of Fireballs every second to defeat Ryan.

"What the hell just how?" Ryan furrowed his eyebrows. "Even if that thing's Meditation and Zen is at level one thousand or something, firing this many projectiles should be impossible."

Before Ryan could mess up again and lose even more mana, he activated Ice Armor. He then teleported to where the copies of the bosses were floating. Not even with his eyes and up close, he could find any difference between the copies.

A few seconds after, the copies changed the direction of their attacks and started to attack Ryan again. He dodged some attacks and let the Ice Armor block some of them, but that didn't help at all. Dozens of Fireballs hit the copies, but not a single one of them actually hit them. They only passed through as if the copies were ghosts.

"How incredibly annoying" Ryan said.

Congratulations! The skill Fire Resistance has leveled up.

Congratulations! The skill Heat Resistance has leveled up.

Ryan was receiving a lot of damage, but he still could counter it by using Regeneration. However, that was just Ryan delaying the inevitable. He needed to think of a way to find the real boss.

In the end, Ryan used Ice Breath to repel the Fireballs. Much to his surprise, the skill alone protected him against all the Fireballs. It even raised a curtain of steam that made everyone in the last part of the dungeon disappear. Ryan activated Silent Movement and then used Teleport. With that alone, he escaped from the boss's vicious attacks and gained some time.

After closing his eyes, Ryan tried to focus his senses in order to notice anything out of place in the dungeon. Although his vision was obstructed, Ryan still could hear and feel any movement within the cloud of steam, but much to his surprise, he found nothing.

Without any other choice, Ryan used Clairvoyance to find the copies within the mist, only to find them clustered in the same place. As expected, the boss was enough to do that since it would be the easiest way to spot Ryan without exposing himself.

Ryan finally had another idea when he saw that. Attacking all of them seemed like a good idea, but Ryan decided to use Ice Breath again, this time upward. By doing so, the boss wouldn't be able to identify Ryan's position since his attack would cross the entire mist and even strengthen it.

When the boss noticed what Ryan was planning was already too late. The copies tried to disperse the mist by reheating everything, but that only worked for speed up Ryan's plans. The ice melted and a short rain fell for a few couple seconds. The boss tried to hide the real one behind several copies, but Ryan found a single copy wet thanks to Clairvoyance. Without holding back, Ryan fired bolts like a machine gun, only to see his attacks be blocked by a Mana Shield in front of the original.

"You found me" The boss said.

"You are not as smart as you think," Ryan shrugged.

Ryan activated Perfect Aim to make sure that the boss wouldn't disappear from his sight again, and the creature noticed that. Cheap tricks wouldn't work anymore. Ryan had already discovered that the original was making Fireballs appear in front of the illusions. The only thing Ryan couldn't understand was how come the illusions could fool his Radar. The most plausible explanation was that the difference in the level of both skills was just that high.

Another thing Ryan couldn't understand was how come the boss could use so much mana, but in the end, the creature wouldn't give him enough time to think about it. Suddenly, a massive quagmire appeared on the ground of the dungeon, but Ryan escaped by flying. From the quagmire, Ryan saw some undead-like hands coming out right below him those certainly would try to grab him if Ryan gets too close, and that was creepy as hell.

"Another illusion?" Ryan muttered.

"Let them grab you and you will soon find out," The boss said.

"No, thank you," Ryan said and then pointed his weapon at the boss.

"I wasn't asking you," The boss said.

Suddenly, Ryan's body got a lot heavier. Even before the system could tell him what was happening, he had already figured out gravity magic. Even though he could considerably stronger since the last time, it looked like his physical strength was as useless as usual even against it.

Congratulations! The skill Gravity Resistance has leveled up.
