Chapter 511: Revenge

Chapter 511: Revenge

Ryan decided to put his plans in motion when he had two hundred Ice Golems under his control. Since he didn't want to leave any of his traces behind, Ryan made his golems run toward the Reptilians camp after he teleported to several kilometers above the camp. Only someone with eyes as good as his would be able to find him.

Before the Ice Golems could be found or start their rampage, Ryan looked for the bosses in the area. They were the most troublesome foes, after all. Much to his surprise, Ryan even found Eci eating something in front of a campfire. It was hard to tell from that position, but he looked pretty down.

"I guess it is only natural, he got his ass kicked many times against me, after all," Ryan shrugged. "It is kind of surprising that he didn't lose his job or was executed for his failures. All villains execute their incompetent minions Maybe I am using the wrong type of knowledge here."

Before Ryan could waste even more time, he used Lunar Arrow and instantly killed Eci and several other bosses. While it was surprising that he did that with a low-level skill, Ryan was more surprised that only their heads were destroyed by the attacks. Even though they probably didn't have Light Resistance, their mentality was surprisingly high.

The Reptilians were caught off guard when their leaders were suddenly shot down, they tried to find the enemy, but they didn't find anything in the dark sky of the night. As if that wasn't enough, the Ice Golems suddenly jumped over the ice walls as if they never existed from the very beginning.

The unarmed Reptilians tried to fight back, but only the guards in the walls managed to deal any real damage at the low-level ice golems. In total synchrony, the Ice Golems fired Ice Arrows at the Reptilians. They managed to kill a few monsters just by the sheer number of projectiles, but that wouldn't be enough. Several other Reptilians got their weapons in the meantime.

"I can't see any more bosses, so I guess I can focus on the regular monsters," Ryan said. "This would be the perfect chance to level up my weakest classes, but I can't let those fuckers see me. I can't use crossbows either. So, now what?"

Ryan couldn't even use the skills he already showed to the Reptilians. While Lunar Arrow was hard to see as a proper arrow, the cost of mana was too high for Ryan to use to kill mob monsters.

In the end, Ryan decided to use something new. Something that could cause a lot of damage even though it was at a low level. Ryan created several boulders using Earth Creation and then let them fall after using Deadly Aim. Gravity did its magic, and then several Reptilians had their heads crushed by the two-hundred-pound boulders after a few seconds.

The skill Earth Creation has leveled up.

"Hehe, this isn't so bad," Ryan grinned from ear to ear.

It was certainly impossible for the Reptilians to identify the attacker by using such a tactic alone. From their perspective, it wouldn't be weird if they think that some meteors were falling at a very bad time.

While that was good and all since the level of the skill was low, Ryan was spending too much time creating the boulders, and while his Ice Golems gained many levels, they were quickly being disposed of by the Reptilians.

"I suppose it is time to retreat, without the bosses, they probably will have a hard time building their strength again," Ryan said.

Ryan felt satisfied by the fact that he discovered a new way to attack while conserving a lot of mana.

When Ryan returned to his camp, he suddenly felt weird. The last few days had been oddly peaceful for him. Even though he killed thousands of monsters not only that, returning to his domain every time was starting to feel like he was returning to his home after a day of work. Even though there was a single thing in all his domain that could make him remember his old home.

"This is weird I guess it is because I have been traveling around nonstop," Ryan said and scratched the back of his head. "Well, now that has come to this, maybe I should teleport that old hut here."

Although that had been his idea, Ryan began to wonder if he should really do it. What was the point? The number of hours in which he sleeps during a week could be counted with the fingers of his hands.

"Nah, I shouldn't let these weird ideas get the better of me," Ryan said. "I can't relax at such times; humans are at war against monsters. Besides"

Ryan didn't want to say that out loud since it would be the same as admitting that his past was haunting him, but he didn't want to become that person, that happy-go-lucky idiot that he once was. Having a home would certainly make him become relatively lax in order for him to leave his combat mode. A house or even a proper bed was completely unnecessary.

"As expected, socializing with other people is making me have more and more thoughts unrelated to fighting," Ryan rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "This isn't a good..."

Fortunately, that was a problem that could easily be solved. Ryan just had to find another target. Even though the whole country was covered by the darkness of the night, Ryan still decided to leave his domain and then look for another dungeon to clear. Anything was better than him returning to his past self, even becoming a death machine, a battle freak, or robot whose sole purpose is to hunt and kill monsters.
