Chapter 581: A Rare Disease

Chapter 581: A rare disease

For a change, Ryan didn't pick the second of the options, and Femradiel questioned him the reason why he did it. In the end, he explained that despite the bonuses in status, he didn't intend to fight in a boat Mariner certainly was a class that would help one fight in boats, and Ryan hated them with passion.

"You dislike boats?" Femradiel asked. "How weird to think that you would have seasickness."

"I don't dislike boats, and I don't suffer from seasickness," Ryan said. "I just have a special condition that makes me unable to stay in boats."

"Let me guess, you get dizzy, light-hearted, and feels like throwing up," Femradiel said. "That is the primary sign of someone who suffers from seasickness."

"As I told you, it isn't seasickness. It is a rare disease that is much worse than seasickness," Ryan insisted. "Those symptoms can't be compared to what someone like me can feel in a boat."

"I am one hundred percent sure that you are just overdramatic," Femradiel shrugged.

While the survivors that Mohammed sent were seeing Ryan and Femradiel arguing in a language they couldn't understand, they preparing their camp inside the dungeon. They knew that fighting the magma golems outside the dungeon would be too much of a pain, even though the dungeon's interior had some small lava pits.

Ryan and Femradiel suddenly left the dungeon by using Teleport. Then they decided to check the situation in the third dungeon. Much to their surprise, Mohammed himself had gone to guard the place, but his group was being attacked by some weird creatures. Ryan immediately recognized them as the humans that had become Chimeras. They were even more disgusting than Ryan had imagined.

Calling them humans was a mistake, so Ryan decided to refer to them as Chimeras and only that. Although their faces remained humans, Ryan could see horns in their heads, horns that made him recall the demons he faced before finding Baal. The Chimeras also had implanted long and pointy green ears those belonged to a species of creature that Ryan had never seen before.

Despite the horns, the monsters had angel-like rings on their backs and they seemed pretty used to the high speed the wings granted them. The limbs of the chimeras were pretty buffy. They obviously had been implanted to grant the monsters super-human strength and endurance. However, the most disgusting thing those creatures had was a big mouth in their stomach. It resembled a mouth of Ryan didn't have a single idea of what could be compared with that. It was just a blood-like mouth that had few dark teeth that could be seen even while the mouth was closed.

"Woah humans surprised me once again," Femradiel frowned when she saw the same thing Ryan did. "This time in a bad way."

Even Ryan couldn't help but feel disappointed. He had never imagined that humans would fall that low for power. While Ryan couldn't complain all that much since he used Draconic Transformation a few times, at least that didn't turn him into an abominable and disgusting creature.

"Great" Ryan said and then sighed.

Upon finding that Appraisal doesn't work on those creatures, Ryan used Teleport. After a few moments, he appeared where Mohammed and his were being attacked. Unfortunately, it looked like Ryan's time had been too good for a change. Not a single one of them had been killed. Instead, they probably focused on the defense. Despite that, Ryan could see a man without both arms bleeding on the ground.

Ryan activated Perfect Aim and Deadly Aim, and in an instant, he summoned five magic copies of his Immobilizing Crossbow. When he began to fire, the five Chimeras finally noticed Ryan's presence, but before they could do anything, the bolts made the monsters fall on the ground.

"Freeze them, Femradiel," Ryan said. "Everything below their necks."

"Understood," Femradiel said.

Femradiel tried to immobilize the targets before they could try to fight back, but much to her surprise, her ice wasn't strong enough. The very moment a thin layer of ice appeared above the bodies, it melted for some odd reason.

Although Ryan never stopped attacking the monsters from above, they still managed to get up and look at him. Even when Ryan duplicated the number of magic bows, the monsters didn't fell down. Ryan noticed that not only they had a fearsome cold and ice resistance, but their bodies were also healing at a crazy speed. While it wasn't unexpected that a monster like that could several high-level traits, Ryan was one hundred percent that they were like that due to the several non-human parts on their bodies. Still, there was no point in wondering about that because the Chimeras began to fly toward him.

Judging by how furious the Chimeras were, Ryan assumed they would charge at him without thinking about anything. Still, much to his surprise, they spread around as if that would make Ryan unable to hit all of them at the same time.

" I really hate this type of strategy," Ryan clicked his tongue and then said.

"Even though you can't be stopped with such a simple strategy?" Femradiel asked.

"Even though I can't be stopped with such a simple strategy," Ryan replied.

The monsters frowned when they saw the bird sitting at the top of Ryan's head talking, but it looked like they could do at least that much since they were using both of their hands to protect their faces from Ryan's bolts. In any case, despite the fact that that area of their bodies didn't have much skin, Ryan's attacks were barely making any blood flow.
