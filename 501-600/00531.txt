Chapter 531: Practice

Chapter 531: Practice

Maybe it was due to the fact that he lost a lot of blood for some other reason. Still, after the fight against the Hydra, Ryan was so hungry that he ended up eating the last dozen dragon hearts on the same day. Also, strangely enough, his body felt full of vigor after those meals.

When Ryan found a dungeon that was spawning Desert Wolves, he didn't hesitate in attacking the monsters with some Stone Bullets. They were pretty fast, so they would be the perfect test subjects for Evading Shot.

Instead of just using the skill when a monster dashed at him, Ryan waited until the last moment to use it. Basically, he just used it when he felt the bad smell coming from the monster's mouths. Then he would use Evading Shot, hit the interior of the nearest monster, and then appear ten meters away from the previous location.

You obtained 120 coins.

"It isn't a skill like Flash and Teleport," Ryan muttered to himself after he saw Evading Shot in action. "Essentially, it is just high-speed movement skill that, unlike the others, can be stopped and seen."

That seemed a bit problematic, but soon Ryan confirmed that wasn't the case. When a pack of Desert Wolves tried to jump toward him, Ryan hit them almost at the same time and then appeared forty-five meters away from his previous position.

You obtained 120 coins.

Congratulations! The skill Evading Shot has leveled up.

You obtained 01 status point.

"I see now I will change my position based on the direction the projectile was fired," Ryan muttered to himself again.

Ryan barely noticed the sudden movements of his body when the effect of the skill took place. He only noticed because he almost missed the last shot since he didn't consider that new fact about the skill. It was another factor that Ryan had to consider while fighting, but it would be more useful than troublesome.

In order to sharpen his sense and become more used to that skill, Ryan let the monsters approach and attack him. He only used the skill at the very last moment but at some point, he got bored since the Desert Wolves always stared at him in confusion after he escaped his attacks. As expected, Ryan would have to face at least a middle-ranked boss to have any decent training.

Although it was unnecessary for the sake of leveling up Evading Shot, Ryan used it whenever he killed a Desert Wolf since he was recovering enough mana to do it. In the middle of the hunt, Ryan even learned a few more gimmicks of the skill. He could activate the skill even when he was using the Magic Bows alone, and the effects could stack. Not only that, Ryan's position would change according to the direction and the order his Magic Bows were fired.

"This is getting kind of complicated, but it is good that I can move without giving any sign with my body to which direction I am going," Ryan nodded to himself in satisfaction.

While Ryan was practicing Evading Shot and killing the Desert Wolves, he recalled that he should contact Gustavo and his friends. He didn't mention that probably Poseidon was controlling the Hydras, after all. So, the chances of them not knowing that were actually high. Without wasting any time, Ryan used the telepathic channel, and Gustavo accepted the call quite quick.

"Ryan? How unexpected, you never started the telepathic link before," Gustavo said.

"I wanted to talk about the Hydras," Ryan said. "I found a big one, and I learned a few things about the situation in the oceans. Did any of you guys tried to clear any underwater dungeons that can be found there?"

"No that was too risky," Gustavo said, and he sounded surprised. "You cleared some underwater dungeons and even fought against a Hydra in there?"

"That is right, I found one moving around these parts, but I guess their numbers aren't that high in the northern part of the Atlantic," Ryan replied.

In the end, the only thing Gustavo and his friends knew was that the Hydras were hunting other species of monsters. They learned that when their draconic partners used their powers to track those monsters down. Another thing they learned was that attacking a domain served as a real good training practice. The bigger the domain, the faster one could level up their skills. That was why the Hydras attacked Gustavo's domain whenever possible.

Ryan didn't obtain all that much information, but in the end, he decided to share everything he learned. After all, few people could or had the nerve to fight in the ocean, and only those who had dragons under control could fight and show their true power. While Ryan was mentioning the events of the last days, he noticed that it was quite weird that Gustavo and his friends didn't explore the oceans, even though their Draconic Transformation was a level much higher than his.

"Poseidon, huh" Gustavo said and then sighed. "It looks like things were getting even more difficult for the human race."

"Do you have any idea how we can slow down the leveling up the speed of the Hydra's dungeon?" Ryan asked. "It would also be interesting if we could find where it is. I am pretty sure it is near where you guys live."

"No, we don't have any idea" Gustavo said and then sighed again. "We also think that their dungeon is indeed close by, but we can't pinpoint its location exactly. All that we know is that there is a massive storm in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. We believe that is caused by the Sea Storm spell that is been cast by dozens of Hydras. Thus, we can't approach it."

"I guess that at least is a start," Ryan said. "For the time being, we can't do anything aside from strengthening ourselves and hope that we will have the chance to do something before Poseidon can manifest himself and show its true power on Earth."
