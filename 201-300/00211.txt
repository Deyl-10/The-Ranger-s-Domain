Chapter 211: Megalodon'S Power

Chapter 211: Megalodon's power

"What happened here it looks like a dragon attacked this fallen dragon to eat the dragon's heart. Ryan frowned."

That was rather disturbing, but then Ryan recalled Orgar's words, some dragons become like that their thirst for power is so big that they attack their own kin. In any case, that was weird, only the last dragon could have done that, but it wouldn't explain the other dragons would stay close to such a dangerous ally.

Instead of worrying about an enemy that had flown instead of fighting him, Ryan decided to look for his spear. Unfortunately, Search only worked on living beings, so Ryan had to look for his weapon the hard way. On the other hand, Ryan knew the spear's trajectory, so he won't have to waste too much time looking. He was already on the right path.

To avoid surprises, Ryan activated Radar, but he didn't find anything. Not even a single living presence could be found, heard, or felt on Long Island. That was very disheartening. Although it would be troublesome to Ryan if he finds some survivors since he had other business, it would be better than just confirming that there was not a single survivor left.

After a while, Ryan finally found his spear hanging in a semi-destroyed harbor and about to fall on the ocean. One didn't have to be a genius to know that was one hell of a scary coincidence. Regardless, Ryan wouldn't approach the ocean knowing what was waiting for him there, so he used Wind Manipulation to obtain control over his spear and pull it back to him. However, the very moment he used his magic, a gigantic creature jumped out from the ocean and moved toward him.

"You have got to be kidding me!" Ryan said.

Ryan was fifty meters away from the ocean, but a fucking megalodon still jumped to cross that distance and attack him. While he was feeling a shrive like no other, he used all his might to pull back the spear as fast as possible, and then he used Flash when the weapon was back in his hand.

Somehow, Ryan escaped, but if he had been a blink of an eye late Regardless, the megalodon ended up kissing the snow, and the ground and the impact made the entire area tremble. When the creature recovered, it began to move like a fish out of water and toward the ocean.

"As if I would let you!" Ryan used Incomplete Reptilian Transformation and then threw his spear.

The Paralyzing Spear hit the monster's head, but it didn't pierce that deeply. However, the megalodon began to get electrocuted, and Ryan made sure to hold his weapon by using Wind Manipulation and make the monster suffer just like that.

"The heck those are some weird statuses," Ryan frowned.

Although Ryan didn't lose his focus and electric attacks were supposed to be the megalodon's weakness, the monster somehow managed to muster the strength to return to the ocean in a single sault. Noticing what was about to happen, Ryan retrieved his spear.

Ryan sighed in relief and then got the hell out of there since it was clear he couldn't defeat such a monster. Maybe they were weak against physical attacks, but Ryan will have a hard time dealing that kind of damage in a monster that spends most of his time in the ocean, and as far as magic was concerned, he wasn't strong enough.

"I guess I can't become a master of all in just two months"

Ryan left Long Island full of doubts. Although he could one-shot kill dragons as long as he has enough time to prepare, killing megalodons seemed impossible following the same strategy. After all, they won't expose themselves outside of water for more than a few seconds. In a sense, those creatures were much troublesome than dragons. That wasn't on his plans yet, but if one day Ryan decides to check things on other continents, those monsters will be a pain in the ass since they can jump pretty high.

"It is almost as if this whole situation wants to make humans hole on the grounds in fear megalodons in the ocean, dragons in the sky this is a sick joke."

Congratulations! You have learned the skill: Cold Resistance.

Effect: Decreases the damage caused by all ice-type attacks and the effects of cold environments by one point per level, even when they don't damage you directly.

You obtained 01 status point.

Although his salamander was using its Flamethrower to heat things whenever possible, Ryan finally obtained that skill. Now he finally realized the salamander already obtained the skill, and it was already at level five maybe his mentality prevented him from suffering the effects of cold until now. Still, now that he was heading north, things were starting to get chilly for him.

"Might as well take a break here and let the salamander level up the skill slowly instead of risking freezing the monster."

Ryan didn't know for how long he will have to work in order to clear the skeletons' dungeon, so he might as well rest while he can before he enters their territory. In the end, Ryan created a small house of earth and then covered everything with snow. Every single creature will see that and think it was only a rock covered in snow from a distance. Ryan avoided even creating a chimney not to give his location to any creature, even though things got really cold at night cold and uncomfortable since he didn't even have a sleeping bag. Ryan sighed before falling asleep now more than ever, he wanted an item to store useful things in a magical dimension. He deserved at least the comfort of pleasant sleep.
