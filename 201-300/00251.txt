"What the hell" Ryan muttered in shock when he saw those crazy statuses. "Level eighty? How?"

Ryan only woke up from his stupor when one of the creatures suddenly disappeared and reappeared on the back of a man and with its mouth open ready to bit his neck. He clicked his tongue and used Telekinesis, the man fell on the ground thanks to the monster's weight, but the creature couldn't move its mouth.

The other monsters also saw Ryan and their attention changed toward him. He was a foe they couldn't ignore, and they knew that. Although they looked like dead brain monsters, they weren't stupid.

"Seven against one, huh A foe like that, and I also don't have any combat experience against it. Well, I already prepared myself for this kind of difficult situation."

Those creatures were fast, but Ryan already knew what he should do to stop them. When the creatures began to run around him, he made his swords fly and then spin around him. The creatures frowned when they saw some powerful-looking weapons flying around Ryan at that speed. Although they were fast enough to pass by that line of defense, they were fully aware that Ryan had absolute control over the weapons, and he could use them to impale the monster that gets too close to him in the blink of an eye. While the monsters were wondering how to proceed, Ryan was charging a Power Shot.

There was no need to be stingy about mana, so Ryan also activated Deadly Aim. After five seconds of charge, Ryan fired, and his arrow hit the head of a Chupacabra, making it explode. The creature was fast, but it wasn't faster than Ryan's arrows.

You obtained 85 coins.

Even the coins Ryan obtained increased a lot as expected. Dealing with those creatures will be hard, and no matter what, he had to prevent the third dungeon break in their dungeon.

When their ally died, the other monsters decided to attack without caring about their safety. When that happened, Ryan made sure to make his weapons fly in their directions. Only one creature didn't get hit by his attacks. However, that same creature was trying to run, but the best it could do was walk thanks to Telekinesis.

"I can get used to this," Ryan said before firing an arrow and hitting the monster's left eye and killing it.

Ryan always knew that several skills could work well with his fighting style, but he didn't imagine that Telekinesis would make his job so easy. The other creatures recovered from the attack and also got rid of the weapons that pierced their bodies. They charged toward Ryan again, but their charge was slowed down thanks to Arrow Shower.

To avoid the area of effect of the skill, the creatures moved toward several directions, but by doing so, they lost sight of Ryan for a second. He had disappeared with their sense of smell. They found him dozens of meters behind them and with his bow ready to fire his Paralyzing Spear. At that point in time, the creatures finally began to feel something aside from their usual thirst for blood it was fear. That unknown human could do many things the others couldn't. Hunting a target like that with a small pack wasn't wise, so they began to slowly retreat.

"I don't think so" Ryan said.

Ryan waited for the power of his attack to increase a little bit, and then when the Chupacabras turned around and started to run, he fired. The monster that got hit by it exploded into several pieces. Soon after, the spear hit the ground, and the impact made several blocks of earth fly and hit the other monsters. That bought Ryan enough time to recover his other weapons and use Flash to finish off the wounded creatures.

After cleaning the sweat from his forehead, Ryan sighed in relief. Those creatures were creepy as hell and stronger than any other mob. Ryan fought so far, but in the end, they could be defeated. Unfortunately, the monsters didn't drop anything, but that was just a minor nuisance. Ryan will have plenty of chances to get drops since he will have to kill dozens of thousands of those creatures in less than ten days.

"I guess I can't ignore them hopefully, they will give me some valuable intel," Ryan concluded.

Ryan wanted to avoid all types of distractions, but the survivors he just saved were heading toward him. It was a group of three men and three women, and while they looked quite beat down, they had weapons and equipment with them.

"Gracias, senior," A black-haired man that had a mustache said. "Nos salvaste de un final terrible."

"Sorry, I can't speak Spanish," Ryan forced a smile.

"Oh you are American" The mustache man said with a worried tone.

"Yes, it looks like you have some reservations about me," Ryan shrugged. "Well, not that I care. Good luck on your journey."

"Wait, wait!" The man said. "Are you heading South? Won't you stop us from entering on your country?"

"I am pretty sure those times are behind us, and I never cared about that kind of stuff," Ryan said. "Wait you are not saying that some Americans prevented you from crossing the border lately, are you?"

"Yes many times during the last weeks, a certain man has been flying around the border" The mustache man replied. "Making sure that no survivor will escape from the Chupacabras."
