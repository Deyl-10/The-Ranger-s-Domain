Chapter 241: Hunting Dragons

Those three dragons decided to run away. However, Ryan didn't felt for that obvious trap. When he looked below him, he saw the two fallen dragons preparing a big attack a lot of mana was being concentrated in front of their mouth, and the mana was turning into ice.

"I can't get greedy here."

Seven dragon hearts surely would help Ryan quite a lot, but he decided to gladly accept four. When the monster opened their mouths a little more, a cannon of ice and snow was fired through it. If Ryan had the time to do it, he would have shaken his head in disapproval What was the point of using such a large attack when Ryan could use Flash and easily avoid it? However, it looked like the dragons considered that. When he reappeared a few meters away from his previous position, the cannons of ice changed their trajectory.

In the end, Ryan decided to stop his wind magic to levitate with his shield. His falling speed was equal to the speed of the dragon's movement, so the ice cannon never reached. Half a second before landing, Ryan fired his arrow, and the special projectile hit the head of the dragon on the left side. The cannon of ice was stopped immediately, and the neck of the creature snapped soon after half of the head exploded.

You obtained 45.000 coins.

The last one still tried to freeze Ryan to death, but before its attack could reach him, he used Flash and reappeared behind the dragon's back, and without hesitation, he swung his ax on the monster. The beast trembled in agony when several of its scales flew to the sides and even tried to roll in order to protect the back of its head, but that had been a mistake. When the monster showed its face and exposed eyes, Ryan fired his twin longswords at the monsters' eyes.

The monster lost its eyes, but even in that condition, the creature tries to smash Ryan with both arms. Escaping wasn't an option. The monster decided to die while fighting. Against a foe that was wounded, Ryan decided to fight melee. However, when he tried to repel one of the dragon's arms, he was sent flying for several meters, and he dislocated his shoulders. Somehow, Ryan landed on his fist and fixed his shoulder before using Heal, but not even that made him give up on fighting up close.

Repelling the attack with his strength alone wasn't possible yet, but Ryan, with his speed, dodged the monster's next attack, swung his ax, and cut off one of the monster's fingers. The same scene repeated itself several times until the creature finally dies of blood loss. Finally, the last dragon dropped a tome, but Ryan didn't feel like celebrating. He won against seven dragons and killed four solo. However, until he obtains the power to do that without relying on potions, there was no point in getting excited.

Effect: creates an ice storm in a small area that causes damage and can freeze your foes.

Damage: 100% per second

Cost: 100 mana per second.

It was a completely useless skill for that environment. Still, given that Ryan himself didn't have area of effect skills on his arsenal aside from the Fire Storm that he could only use thanks to his twin swords, it was a nice skill to welcome. Still it seemed kind of cheap given that Ryan killed four dragons. Fortunately, the best was yet to come.

Your health increased by twenty points.

Your mana increased by twenty points.

Your willpower increased by twenty points.

Your dexterity increased by twenty points.

"I guess this isn't half bad." Ryan nodded in satisfaction.

It was a pity to leave those bodies behind, but since his ring couldn't store a lot, Ryan left the area without looking back. At first, he thought of fishing a little bit those damn megalodons, but instead of that, he headed toward the center of the city and looked for the dungeon. It was time to get another class and put his dire wolf in his office.

Ryan felt alone many times over the last two months. Most of the time, he felt like that because of the destruction and lack of survivors in the places he passed. However, that feeling was a lot stronger in that city due to the snow. The cold and strong wind made everything look so desolate and dead. suddenly, Ryan caught some presence hidden among a massive pile of snow that was probably hiding a house or something. Nine survivors were in there to think that humans could survive this long in such a desolate place that was at the same time, so freezing cold although that surprised Ryan, he soon moved onward toward the dungeon. His job wasn't to look after survivors. Besides, if those people managed to survive even though dragons were flying over the city for several weeks, they didn't need his help.

When Ryan finally found some ice foxes, he couldn't help but blink several times since the monsters were hiding in the snow thanks to their white fur. If he hadn't used Radar, he probably would have missed them. When he stopped, the monsters noticed that the surprise attack had failed and prepared to bombard him with ice arrows, but before that could happen, Ryan decimated them with Flame Arrows. Although his magic lost speed and power due to the conditions of the ambient, the ice foxes still died after getting hit a single time it looked like Ryan will have an easy time clearing the dungeon.
