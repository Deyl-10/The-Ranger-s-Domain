Chapter 90: Tyranossaurus Rex

After another day of grinding, Ryan nodded in satisfaction while looking at his status and skills. Thanks to his increased dexterity, Ryan reached a point where he could hit enemies 150 meters away from him with ease, even though he was using his left arm.

After using all the free points, he had, Ryan decided to test his offensive power and he actually felt pity toward the poor velociraptor. His steel bolt hit the monster's head and made it explode. Probably not even a grenade could do that Ryan's attack reached a point that was even influencing his steel bolt. The weapon trembled every time Ryan used it, and when the bolts crossed the air, it flew, causing a high-pitching sound he never heard before. Although his eyes were good, the projectiles could fly at a speed that not even he could see.

"I guess dexterity even influences the speed of projectiles," Ryan frowned. "Anyway, it looks like focusing on a single stat also has its own demerits since bows and crossbows rely alone of dexterity, focusing on that alone makes them reach their true potential much faster than they should."

Given that his normal attacks could cause that much damage, Ryan was looking forward to the power of his level fifteen Power Shot. In any case, he couldn't but once again think that he was getting powerful too fast. It was true that he had a dungeon to himself, and that wasn't something that others had, but still

"Oh, well," Ryan shrugged. "It is not like I'm some sort of idiot who will plan world domination with this power. I just need and want power because I can obtain it now, just like everyone else. Besides, it is not like it is an option considering that there are dragons on Earth. Anyway, let's play with the T-rex."

Although Ryan wanted to test his skills, just to be safe, he left his things at the dungeon entrance and decided to carry only the gear that he was wearing, his steel crossbow and ten mana potions, and other ten stamina potions. Although he could buy more, he wouldn't feel satisfied if he defeats the monster only because he had such an advantage over the beast.

Ryan knew that the dungeon was immense, but it looked like he underestimated its true dimensions. Even though he walked for a full hour, he didn't find the end of it. As if that wasn't enough, the path was heading downward at a steady pace, and the temperature was rising to the point where even Ryan began to sweat.

Still, eventually, they found the lair of the beast. As expected, he found a purple crystal, a treasure box, and the dungeon's boss. Ryan gulped when he saw that massive beast. It was exactly like the monster he saw in that movie even though the boss was sleeping in front of the crystal, Ryan felt a massive pressure. As far as he could remember, T-rexes could weight between four tons, and who knows what could be the limit of those beasts and that one seemed to be on the large size.

"Well let's hope a good loot from this one since I didn't get any tome despite having increased my luck yesterday," Ryan said, and then pointed his crossbow at the beast. "Cheers to the fact that I always have the right for the pre-emptive strike."

There was no point in attacking first if Ryan doesn't attack with the maximum of his power. So, he held his crossbow steadily and began to charge his Power Shot alongside Lesser Wind Enchantment. It would be nice if his spell could work like Power Shot which its power would increase with every passing moment, but that wasn't the case. Still, after receiving so much energy, the crossbow began to tremble, and Ryan was having a hard time keeping the aim steady. Fortunately, the very moment Ryan's stamina was emptied, his aim was perfectly aligned with the beast's left eye. So, he pulled the trigger.

Although the T-rex woke up at the very moment, it didn't have time to react. Ryan's steel bot hit the monster's left eye and made the eyeball and every piece of flesh nearby explode. The sight of a velociraptor getting destroyed by his arrows couldn't even be compared to that. If his ordinary shots had the power of a grenade, that full-powered shot had the power of a tank.
