Chapter 394: Silver Tiger

Chapter 394: Silver Tiger

Ryan had to cross a small part of the Pacific Ocean to reach the place where Femradiel found human presence, and much to his surprise, some survivors were really fighting against each other. As if that wasn't enough, he saw two massive beasts fighting against each other as well. A silver tiger and a black tortoise.

Ryan felt like he watched some crazy movie while those stupidly large monsters were rampaging around and destroying the terrain. A single step was enough to make the ground tremble, and when they turned their bodies around, the survivors had to focus on not getting thrown away by the gusts of wind.

"Ryan, those are dungeon bosses," Femradiel said.

The bosses had the same size of dragons, but they were stronger than any dragon Ryan saw until now. While that was an important characteristic, Ryan ignored that and was wondering as to why the monsters were facing each other and ignoring the Japanese and the other way around. Why the heck the survivors were ignoring them

"I am sensing a strange link between the humans here and those beasts," Femradiel said. "It is a link similar you and Furball have that link is giving humans power."

Ryan's expression darkened in the end. It looked like those survivors decided to join the monsters' side. While they were still living on Earth, that doesn't change anything from Ryan's perspective.

After using Appraisal on the survivors, Ryan saw that they had certain skills that looked very weird. Those who were on Byakko's side had the Autumn's Blessing, and those on Genbu's side had the Winter's Blessing. Ryan had no idea what those skills could do, but given that now and then, the survivors could cover their bodies with flames or lightning, he concluded that they were some type of elemental power up.

" Let's give them a single chance," Ryan grabbed his crossbows and then summoned the magic bows. "As for the monsters, they won't have the same privilege."

While Ryan wasn't so above ground level, he was close enough to let the survivors see him, and they finally found him when Ryan started to rain bolts and magic bolts over the two massive beasts. Their health quickly decreased since he focused on hitting their heads.

The Japanese survivors stopped fighting against each other and found the unknown man attacking the two monsters and couldn't help but open their mouths wide in surprise. In their eyes, that was insanity.

When the two beasts finally found Ryan, they also stopped attacking each other, and they opened their mouths toward him. A lightning bolt and a fire cannon flew toward Ryan, but he blocked the attacks with his shield. While the shield's durability decreased by fifty percent in a single instant, the monsters' received some of the reflected damage and were forced to stop their attacks.

"You might want to speed up things a little bit," Femradiel said.

Doing that alone was impossible, but instead of asking for help, Ryan focused his attacks on Byakko. The silver tiger immediately assumed a defensive instance while Ryan aimed at the monster's eyes. To stop the unknown threat, the beast tried to jump attack Ryan, but Genbu bites Byakko's tail.

Ryan shook his head in disapproval. In the end, monsters will always be monsters. They could only see a single path in front of them, the path where everything would end in their favor.

Byakko's health was quickly approaching dangerous levels, so some of the survivors decided to attack Ryan. They fired many long-ranged electric attacks toward him, but before the number of attacks could escalate, the other survivors did the same as Genbu and attacked them from behind.

"So, it is going to be like that, huh" Ryan furrowed his eyebrows. "What a pity"

While Genbu was holding back Byakko, Ryan pointed his crossbows toward those that attacked him. In an instant, fifteen survivors died when bolts pierced their hearts. The other ones froze in shock when they confirmed the power of someone who decided to challenge those massive beasts.

You obtained 33.457 coins.

"You didn't hesitate I am surprised," Femradiel said.

"You already know that I won't forgive those that attack me," Ryan said.

The other group of survivors stepped back, and Ryan decided to ignore them for the time being and then focused his attention on Byakko again. Before the black tortoise could finish off the monster with a single bite on its neck, Ryan used Seal and then transplanted the boss's soul on a crossbow. Ryan finally obtained his first magic weapon enchanted with the power of electricity.

Thunder Lord Crossbow (Electric)

Effect: fire bolts at the cost of fifty points of mana that shock your foes for 0.25 seconds.

Dexterity + 150, Intelligence + 60

Without wasting time, Ryan pointed his new weapon at Genbu. When huge chunks of flesh began to fall from the monster's face, the other survivors also attacked Ryan it looked like Ryan would have to cause another human massacre.
