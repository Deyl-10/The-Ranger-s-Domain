Chapter 381: Anesthetic Effect

Chapter 381: Anesthetic effect

When the sun was starting to set, Ryan had already done all of his preparations. Still, in the end, he caught himself being overly worried about the possible outcomes. He even gave some of his potions to Natasha, but in the end, he also lent his spatial ring that was completely filled with them. Why? Because Ryan wouldn't need any potions

"All right, buddy," Ryan said to Furball. "Your job is to keep attacking the monsters from a safe distance. You will be carrying someone else on your back, so try to be gentle. Also, don't bite her unless she is a lost cause."

Natasha frowned when she heard that. If it was a joke, it wasn't funny, and Ryan didn't smile or laugh either. In any case, she was thankful for the fact that she would move on Furball's back. He was fast and sturdy, so he was a perfect watch wolf.

"On Furball's back, you will be able to use Firing Posture," Ryan said. "Don't start attacking until you hear any noise or movement from the monster's side."

"Are you sure this is a good idea?" Natasha said while pointing at the spatial ring. "You might be overestimating your abilities. To protect a crazy bitch like her, anyone will need all the help they can get."

"I prepared a plan B, and that isn't something I would like to show to your friend," Ryan said.

"Anyway, don't cause problems to Furball. Unless you want to get bitten."

After a while, Irina finally showed herself, and much to Ryan's surprise, her bodyguards, would stay behind again. Ryan couldn't understand why she would travel around with those guys to the battlefield when they were utterly useless. Despite the fact that she was going to face an army of hundreds of thousands with only two others on her side, Irina looked confident as always.

"Let's go," Irina said.

Although she took the lead, Irina had to wait for Ryan to make then levitate. Since they were several kilometers away from the dungeon, they had to fly for a while but eventually arrived in the area exactly two kilometers above from the bosses. Irina couldn't see them due to the distance and the darkness of the night, though.

"I can't see them from here, we will have to get closer," Irina said.

"If we do that, they will notice us," Ryan said. "Don't worry I will drop you right in above one of them. All you have to do is wait and use Concentrated Strike."

"You are not here to give me orders," Irina said.

Ryan was starting to consider letting Irina fall and not cover for her since she was an annoying bitch. Now that he thought about it, despite everything, she was quite stupid. After all, she was under Ryan's mercy, and still, she didn't change her behavior.

After taking some deep breaths, Ryan decided to put his plans into action. Killing more than two or three bosses in that situation before they get closer was impossible, but decreasing their numbers wasn't the only thing Ryan could do to make the fight easier. Ryan took out several of the magic weapons he created in the last few days to level up his skills and then made them spin. After that, he activated Perfect Aim and fired them in the direction of the boss's eyes. In a single instant, Ryan blinded six of them. Although he wished that he could have attacked like that five more times, Ryan only successfully managed to blind the other six bosses. The others found him and Irina and began to fly toward them. However, they were forced to stop because that area began to tremble thousands of golems were marching toward the army of monsters.

"Good it is working," Ryan smiled when he saw his mana being recovered at insane speeds.

Ryan grabbed his two crossbows and also made two magic bows that were copies of the heavy crossbows and made dozens of bolts rain over the bosses that were hesitating.

"Hey, that wasn't part of the plan," Irian protested.

"It was, this is the only way to prevent you from being surrounded by those freaks," Ryan said.

Ryan tried to slow down the bosses as much as possible, but in the end, after just a couple of seconds, those gigantic flies were already close to them. Femradiel controlling Irina made her fly toward the monsters, and even before those creatures could do anything to attack her, she appeared close to one of them and attacked the monster's eyes. At least she was smart enough to understand that blinding the enemies was something absolutely necessary.

The bosses tried to surround her since they couldn't use their spells while they were so close to each other, but Ryan made sure to pierce them with the short spears he had prepared beforehand to use as projectiles.

Ryan managed to blind two other bosses, but the others noticed the attack and escaped. Much to Ryan's surprise, the blinded bosses decided to retreat. They probably will be able to regenerate their damaged eyes, but Ryan at least managed to buy some minutes.

While the monsters' attention was on Ryan again, Femradiel made Irina move around the monsters at incredible speeds. Ryan was pretty sure that she was using her own powers instead of relying on Ryan's status, but it wasn't time to complain. Suddenly, the bosses opened their mouths, and they made dozens of small flies fly toward Irina. Ryan attacked them, but some still escaped their numbers were just too high.

Instead of flying in circles, Femradiel suddenly changed Irina's trajectory and made her fly around all directions. Trying to predict where she would go next was impossible, which made her escape from the flies. However, that came with a price

"You are going too far" Irina complained while her face was blue due to dizziness.
