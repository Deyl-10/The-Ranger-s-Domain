Chapter 321: Welcome

Chapter 321: Welcome

"All right what the hell is going on here?" Ryan asked with a big frown on his face.

"Should I spoil the surprise?"

"You know something?" Ryan asked.

"Yes, but since I am not going to gain anything by giving you this information, I am going to stay quiet about it. No... even if I say it, you won't believe me."

While that annoyed Ryan a little bit, it was fine. He eventually would discover why Brazil had so many walled cities along the coast. Although it was weird since the cities he found were pretty big, and dragons liked to destroy big cities. Megalodons had also probably been a problem to them for a while

Suddenly, when he was flying and thinking about what to do next, Ryan felt some presence approaching in the distance. His eyes were that good, so he immediately saw some individuals flying toward him. Given that they could fly at a pretty decent speed, their strength couldn't be ignored Moreover, Ryan could see five of them.

Immediately, Ryan began to charge his Power Shot, but when those guys finally got close enough to see him, they didn't attack. They frowned as if they had been disappointed by something. Those five were humans, three men, and two women. A big, tall man who was also bald stepped forward. The very moment Ryan thought he was bald, the man's eyebrows twitched he had read his mind. In an instant, Ryan used Appraisal in all of them.

Ryan clicked his tongue since he saw that they were humans, he lowered his guard a bit and forgot to use Appraisal when he should have. Regardless, it was too late to complain they were all humans that had made a pact with dragons, and they were at the same level as Lucas. Fighting against all of them at the same time won't be easy.

"Are you American?" Carlos asked.

"What if I am?" Ryan asked while frowning.

"I am not bald," Carlos asked. "I just shaved my head."

" What?" Ryan frowned.

"You are young, but that doesn't mean you can give nicknames to other people in your head," Carlos continued.

"That can wait, Carlos" A black-haired man moved forward and then said that. "My name is Gustavo. May I ask what you are doing here, Ryan? You are a long way from home."

"I am investigating the continent and looking for some special dungeons," Ryan replied. "Are you guys from this country?"

Although Ryan wasn't from these parts, he felt like he should ask some questions as well. It would be pretty stupid to let them control the conversation flow while giving information away and not getting any. Surprisingly, the man called Gustavo replied readily.

"Yes, we are," Gustavo replied. "So, you are doing some investigative work for your country?"

"No, I am doing this for my own purposes," Ryan replied.

"I see. I trust you," Gustavo said. "Should we talk in a more appropriate place? I can understand why you are on high alert, but I can assure you that we have no intention of harming humans that don't want to cause problems."

"Do you trust me because you can read my mind or because you want to make me cancel my skill?" Ryan asked.

"For both reasons, I guess," Gustavo forced a smile. "But I guess the main reason is that you flew over some of our camps and did nothing against them. We were worried because you have the presence of a dragon inside you but it looks like your situation is different from ours."

"They are not lying. They are goody-two-shoes idiots like that Lucas guy you met before."

Ryan sighed. He couldn't understand why Femradiel would give such information to him and refuse to give others. Regardless, those people had some interesting classes, so perhaps talking with them would be a good idea. Ryan didn't find anything weird while he passed through those camps, people lived normally, and he even saw kids playing around it looked like the situation in Brazil was considerably better thanks to those five.

"I guess I will accept your offer," Ryan said and then stored his crossbow away.

Although Ryan seemed harmless without his main weapon, he could take out dozens of his special arrows in the blink of an eye. So, he was confident that he could escape any possible ambush. Besides, the chances of him getting caught off-guard while he uses Radar and Awareness were quite low.

"Awesome, but before we head to our headquarters, let me introduce you, my friends," Gustavo said. "This is Paulo, and the guy who doesn't like to be called bald is Carlos."

Paulo was another black-haired guy, but he looked a bit short and young. Perhaps he was in his teens.  The girls' names were Fernanda and Bianca. Fernanda was a blond, blue-eyed girl who seemed to be quite timid or disliked strangers quite a lot since she never kept eye contact for more than a few moments. Bianca was a redhead, not a natural one, but even so, the color always made Ryan frown while looking at her.

Maybe it was a coincidence, but each one of them had made a pact with a dragon of a different element. That being said, all of them had more or less the same level of strength and that wasn't something Ryan could think that was a coincidence.
