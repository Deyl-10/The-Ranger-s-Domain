Chapter 461: The Right Time

Chapter 461: The right time

"Our status hasn't grown as much as I had expected," Femradiel said while Ryan was making the final preparations for his attack. "You forgot to eat the dragon hearts, didn't you?"

" No I was just waiting for the right moment to eat them," Ryan forced a smile.

" While I think that is good that you still can get nervous, you should get your shit together," Femradiel said after a long sigh. "What happened to the cold Ryan that couldn't care less about the results of his action as long as he survives another day?"

"He went on a vacation when he created a perfect place for the invaders to build their forces," Ryan replied. "No matter what, I can't let them get this domain."

"While that is only obvious, you know that will only happen when you die, right?" Femradiel said. "You should focus on what you can do to not die and by proxy, you will succeed in achieving everything else."

That was logical in theory, but now that Ryan thought about it, he started to feel certain things around the time he began to feel more relaxed, thanks to Furball and Femradiel. Who could have thought that anger could make you so unaware of some obvious problems like the fear of failure?

Regardless, it was time to focus on the fight ahead. While Ryan could attack the enemies from his domain, he decided to expose himself a little more and then wipe out the three groups of monsters at the same time.

"Do you think that you can hold back the minotaurs if you use your two bodies?" Ryan asked.

"Holding them back should be possible if I combine the powers of those two bodies, defeating them in a few minutes is another matter altogether," Femradiel replied. "In any case, the set of abilities of those three species of monsters are bothering me."

"It is because they could work well together, right?" Ryan asked.

"Indeed, and even though they split their forces, they can quickly move and offer support to the other groups if we don't attack all of them at the same time," Femradiel said.

Ryan was aware of that as well. However, not only wasn't possible to attack the three groups at the same time, but it was also unlikely that he will be able to snipe them. Ryan had imagined some scenarios, and he could easily see them taking place in the next few minutes.

"Well, let's focus on decreasing their numbers first," Ryan said. "It is not like we need to defeat all of them in a single attack."

Femradiel nodded at that. In the end, Ryan gave her some time to get used to controlling two bodies. Ryan imagined that doing that would be like typing at two keyboards with his eyes closed and multiplying that already hard task by ten. When the two familiars left the domain, Ryan gave the order to Furball to stay behind. He needed some countermeasures, after all in case something unexpected happens. However, even before he could do anything, something already happened. The centaurs and giant skulls began to move.

"So, they really are going to offer support to each other, huh," Ryan said, a bit annoyed.

Ryan used Teleport and appeared a few hundred meters away from the giant skulls. Then he began to attack them with his Spiritualist Crossbow. The monsters summoned their mana shields and blocked all the damage Ryan tried to cause and even nullified the power of his special bolts. In the meantime, the Centaur Archers dashed toward him. Before the skulls' mana could even reach the midway point, arrows began to rain over Ryan.

"I knew it" Ryan clicked his tongue in annoyance since he had imagined that scenario taking place.

Ryan used Teleport and appeared behind the Centaurs. After summoning his Magic Bows, he made bolts rain over the monsters. However, much to his annoyance the Giant Skulls used Mana Shields to protect them.

"Go on, Buddy," Ryan gave the order to Furball.

In just a few seconds, Furball joined the fight and immediately crashed several Giant Skulls. However, before he could cause any real damage to the enemies' troops, the Giant Skulls divided into two groups, one to offer support to Centaurs who still were trying to hit Ryan and another one to defend the group against Furball.

"All right, let's return," Ryan declared.

"Already?" Femradiel asked. "I didn't have to kill even a single one here."

"It is fine," Ryan said. "Let's adapt our strategy with the knowledge we obtained now."

Using Teleport, Ryan brought back Furball and Femradiel to his domain. After using some potions to restore their mana, Ryan also used some STR potions to increase Furball's physical damage and INT potions to boost Femradiel's power.

"Is that it?" Femradiel frowned.

"No, there is something else," Ryan replied. "Try to charge some attacks, I will teleport you to the back of the Minotaurs."

"Isn't it a bit too soon to show them that you can do that?" Femradiel asked.

"It doesn't matter, I have other tricks up my sleeve and I think it will be more effective to let them wonder which one we will use afterward."

Femradiel began to charge Niffelheim, and then when the time came, Ryan teleported her toward the Minotaurs back. When she unleashed her spell, only a few dozen monsters turned into ice statues. Still, then they broke into species when her other body, enveloped by electricity, charged at them. With lightning speed, the Minotaurs reached to their assault and immediately turned around and assumed defensive stances. Ryan watched all of them from above and learned another thing After using Teleport again, Ryan returned to his domain and brought with him the two familiars.

"Did you notice that?" Femradiel asked.

"Yep they responded too fast to that attack," Ryan nodded with a serious expression on his face. "They looked like machines machines that were being controlled completely by something else."
