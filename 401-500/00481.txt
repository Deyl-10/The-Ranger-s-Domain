Chapter 481: Decision

Chapter 481: Decision

In the end, Ryan spent the night Clairvoyance. He reached the point where he could see things happening back in Shreveport for a few seconds. If he tried to use some INT potions, he would be able to do a little bit more, but Ryan decided to save those for the time he starts to train the Conjurer class. Maybe his attack speed firing magic projectiles might reach the same speed he fires his bolts

"I guess for a few days I am free of attacks from other army made of monsters," Ryan nodded to himself when the sun began to rise. "Regardless I can finally return to my task of training my tamed monsters."

Thanks to those hours of resting, Ryan's mind was working much better than before. He had the idea of training the skills of his Elementalist class while training the resistances of the Red Falcons. Since the skills were at a low level, they wouldn't suffer all that much. At the same time, his Frozen Slimes also reached level twenty, and now they were finally giving Ryan some profit.

"How are things on your end, Ryan?" Alissa suddenly asked by forcefully activating the telepathic channel.

"How did you" Ryan frowned. "Forget about it I faced some problems, but I solved them in the end. That is all."

"Give me details," Alissa said.

"I don't want to," Ryan said. "Why did you call me at such a time? Aren't you suppose to be busy with the arrival of the new dungeons?"

"Nah, we have things under control thanks to my guys," Alissa replied. "Anyway, despite everything, the people here in the base are being pushed more and more against the wall. I just wanted to tell you that."

"What do you mean by despite everything?" Ryan asked.

"What I meant is, things are great for me," Alissa said, and she seemed pretty cheerful for some reason. "Arthur is already as big as a two years old kid and he finally called me "mama," so I can't see how things could improve from this."

"Is there any doctor in the base that can check if this growth speed isn't causing some issues to his body?" Ryan asked. "I don't think that is relevant, but you said that she finally called you that, but you didn't say that was the first time."

"You had to remind me of that yeah, he called Mia first, must for my annoyance, but it is fine" Alissa said after taking deep breaths to calm down her nerves. "I can more or less check the situation of his body just fine and I didn't notice anything off. Some doctors also confirmed that. According to Orgar, dragons are also creatures that grow fast, but they don't suffer any issues from it."

Ryan couldn't help but sigh since Alissa was dumb enough to compare a few months old boy with a dragon Regardless, he was fine, and that was all that mattered. As for the other guys in the base, aside from Zoe and Arthur, he couldn't care less about them.

"Although I am giving them a hand pretty often nowadays, things are getting complicated," Alissa said. "Even Zoe is working pretty hard from adults' standards."

"Why now of all times you mentioned that" Ryan sighed. "Why aren't you helping her?"

"I like the kid, so I am doing what I can, but I have responsibilities over my soldiers," Alissa replied. "When it comes down to it, I don't have any other choice but choose them over her."

" What is happening over there?" Ryan asked while he was massaging his forehead.

"The naivety of your friends is the problem, they don't have enough manpower to keep the dungeons they want over their control and thus the number of wounded is increasing," Alissa said. "They tried to use your methods to keep some dungeons under control but it isn't working. Summoner class, Beastmaster class or the Necromancer class isn't enough for them."

"If you had to pinpoint a problem, the core problem, what would that be?" Ryan asked.

"I guess it is the fact that they don't have many survivors who are good at fighting in close range," Alissa explained. "Those who stayed behind are good people, but they didn't become true warriors in the last six months. Those who left had become true warriors asshole warriors, but warriors nonetheless."

Ryan couldn't understand how come they couldn't solve that problem with summoned monsters. The tome to learn Summon Golem should be something some of them could acquire After thinking for a while, Ryan came to the conclusion that few people could control hundreds of monsters. Probably their control status was low. That was an attribute that archer-based class could increase a lot, and by the look of things, most survivors of the base followed the magic route. It was obviously a less difficult path for most people, after all.

"The problem is that they chose the safest and easiest options since the very beginning," Ryan said.

"I guess so, what are you going to do?" Alissa asked.

"Don't always assume that I am going to do something," Ryan said and then rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "You disappointed me, Alissa. To think that you couldn't solve such small problems easily"

"Nice try, Ryan," Alissa said. "You aren't going to succeed in taunting me to solve the problems of others. Unlike you, I don't like to solve certain problems using unexpected strategies, I have been taking a liking to clearing dungeons by myself. Besides, as far as I am concerned, the faster those creatures come to this world, the better. I will find the answer Orgar is looking for that way more easily."

Ryan sighed in the end, Alissa had become a battle freak, but unlike Ryan, she wasn't a worrywart. Leaving dungeons unguarded was something that could easily do without a care and from her perspective, what Mark and the others were trying to do was something impossible. Still, Ryan didn't want to solve their problems, but he at least decided to give them a wake-up call.
