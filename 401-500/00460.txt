Ryan used Appraisal to confirm some things, but, in the end, despite the weird fact that the monsters' level wasn't supposed to be that high, he confirmed what he knew based on their appearances. Centaurs were like humans who had horse-like legs, but their ears were a bit longer and pointy, and they also had a hairy body. The Giant Skulls were exactly that, giant skulls they could fly around, and they had some red spheres inside them to represent their eyes. Ryan couldn't identify any other special features in their bodies. As for Minotaurs, they were humanoid bulls that could walk on two legs and had an ax as their weapon Ryan couldn't remember many monsters that actually could use weapons.

" They don't look like undead or poison monsters, so why there is some miasma leaving their dungeon?" Ryan frowned. "Only the Giant Skulls, but there isn't a skill that determines that in their skill set."

Now that he thought about it, Ryan didn't find anything in the dungeon masters' menu that could grant him the power to change the environment of the interior of the dungeon that much. He knew that the monsters' presences could change Earth's environment, even more so when they become stronger. Still, then again, those three species of monsters didn't look like they lived in a world like that or possessed that kind of magic attribute.

Ryan thought those creatures would immediately attack his domain, but they spread around the area, much to his surprise. While it wasn't perfect, they managed to create an encirclement and secure some points that looked like they would be advantageous to them. The Centaurs moved to the peak of a mountain. The Giant Skulls positioned themselves in some hills. The Minotaurs just stopped moving when they found a terrain without undulations.

After a while, a few other monsters began to leave the dungeons. Ryan thought that the first group that consisted of a few hundred had done something weird to increase their level, like killing each other, but much to his surprise, the others also had the same level of power.

"They certainly didn't use a cheap trick," Femradiel suddenly said. "I am ready, do you wish to sign the contract with another familiar."

" Yeah, better be prepared for all possible scenarios before we start this fight," Ryan nodded after frowning.

The ice Wyrm, Fem, wishes to become your familiar. Do you wish to make a pact with her? Y/N.

The new familiar was kind of weird. According to Ryan's knowledge, the Drake species couldn't be found in any mythological story about dragons. They were wingless dragons; they could easily move while using their four legs. Since the new familiar was kind of small, it made Ryan recall an armored but slimmer horse. The scales covering its body sometimes even emanated electricity, so Ryan was expecting a lot from it.

"This time I decided to make a sturdier familiar," Femradiel said. "While this body doesn't have much mobility, you can expect that I will be able to draw a lot of the enemies' aggro and resist for some time while I keep the attention of our foes."

"I am more interested in how you learned and leveled up such skills in such a short time," Ryan frowned.

"You know that I can do all kinds of things inside you, right?" Femradiel asked. "Training is just one of them."

"You make it sound so weird" Ryan frowned even more. "Anyway, I am starting to think that it isn't a good idea to let those guys build their forces."

"You are such a worrywart," Femradiel said. "Well, clearing those dungeons also might help us in the long run, if other dungeon masters think that we aren't that confident and we are trying to clear the dungeon as fast as possible, they will attack us even more eagerly, thus, we will be able to cover more dungeons in the domain."

"For some reason, I think that idea is also quite insane," Ryan said.

"You can't complain about insanity," Femradiel said. "After all, you have been making enemies out of legendary creatures left and right."

"You got me there," Ryan shrugged.
