Chapter 491: Enemies' Strategy

Chapter 491: Enemies' Strategy

When suddenly twenty-five thousand goblins archers appeared in front of him, with their arrows nocked and ready to be shot, Ryan couldn't help but open his eyes widely in surprise. He waited for the moment they would fire the arrows, but the moment never came. Instead, they waited for the moment where Ryan would pass above them. Ryan used Teleport to escape. Still, then he noticed that only a few of them had fired, and the others were already aiming at his next location.

When Ryan saw their status, he noticed why they were so fast to correct their aim and fire. He used his shield to block the projectiles since it was obvious that the dungeon master wanted to make him run out of mana. Still, as expected given their high dexterity, the shield's durability began to decrease quite fast.

As if that wasn't enough, the dungeon master also decided to change their strategies a little more. Instead of teleporting around the whole army, he divided the shamans and archers into smaller groups. He put them around the numerous towns in the area. When Ryan got close to them, he was bombarded by magic projectiles and arrows.

"Shit I will need to change my plans again," Ryan clicked his tongue in annoyance.

Ryan had already predicted that a fight against any decent dungeon master would be like a game of chess. Still, he didn't predict it would be that annoying. He should have brought Femradiel with him although she could talk with him, noticing any powerful presence nearby was impossible.

"Wait a minute why didn't I try that before?" Ryan frowned when a sudden idea came to his mind.

When Ryan and his Red Falcon approached the next town, he was welcomed by two hundred goblins, shamans, and two hundred archers. Instead of teleporting to another position, he made his pet change its trajectory. At the same time, he used Telekinesis on ten goblin archers that had relaxed their posture after firing. However, he used Telekinesis to steal their bows. Trying to steal the weapons of ten enemies had been a bit too much for Ryan, but he at least succeeded in stealing six of them.

"Yep, they really are monsters summoned by the dungeon master crystal," Ryan nodded to himself. "These are some shitty bows still, they will recover some of my mana."

Succeeding in doing the same with the goblin shamans will be a bit harder due to the Mana Shield, but as far as he was concerned, causing such a headache for the dungeon master was more than enough for the time being. Killing those monsters while trying to dodge their attacks and projectiles was a bit difficult, but stealing their weapons wasn't.

Ryan relaxed a little. Now his head was cool enough that he missed some important pieces of information when he used Appraisal on the goblin archers. Why they could use Power Shot at level two hundred when Ryan's limit was level one hundred? Whoever created the system and the limitations humans had, the bastard certainly wanted to see the humans struggle in one hell-like of a disadvantageous environment.

After using Mana-Eater and recovering some mana thanks to the bows, Ryan proceeded to repeat the previous action. Still, naturally, the archers tried to resist. However, Ryan learned that if he focuses on three of them at a time, the monsters couldn't counter his actions. Unfortunately, his Red Falcon started to get hit and suffered some serious damage since the monsters already knew that Ryan was planning.

" I guess I can't do this all the time," Ryan bit his lips in annoyance. "It is time to give those assholes another bombastic surprise, that will buy me some time for the next plan."

Ryan and his Red Falcon flew skyward, but then Ryan jumped while the goblins still could see him. Since the dungeon master divided his forces, the number of creatures trying to attack Ryan decreased, but the vast concentration of projectiles wasn't something Ryan could laugh at. With Telekinesis, he stopped the arrows from hitting him, and by using Water Manipulation, and Hydromancy he obtained control of the Ice Spears the shamans cast. At the same time, Ryan used those to destroy the Fire Spears.

Thanks to the elemental advantage, the ice projectiles were lasting long enough for Ryan to use them as a shield. When the shamans noticed that Ryan was plotting something, they stopped using ice magic, but it was too late. After making the several smaller Ice Spears spin, Ryan fired. In the exact same moment, he teleported them to where the shamans were. The creatures tried to defend themselves with Mana Shield, but they failed miserably. The very moment the projectile hit the ground, the Charge Traps Ryan had put in them exploded, destroying everything around, even in the archers that were several dozen meters away.

"Oh, boy" Ryan frowned while smiling. "What they say is really true, necessity really breeds innovation."

Ryan already had another nasty idea in mind. While that would make him level up some classes he had left behind, it certainly would solve the current problematic situation
