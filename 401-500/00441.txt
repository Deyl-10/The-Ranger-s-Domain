Chapter 441: Death'S Specters

Chapter 441: Death's Specters

Ryan began to study the map where Mark had put the locations of all dungeons. Some of them were still blue, but more than half of the dungeons were red, while three of them were purple. Ryan recognized Baal and Lilith's dungeon, but he had no idea who was the dungeon master of the third one, which was localized in Dallas.

" What that dungeon is spawning?" Ryan asked.

" Why are you interested in that region?" Mark frowned.

"That is none of your business. Answer the question," Ryan said.

"Mind your tongue when you are talking to my father," Hugo glared at Ryan. "Otherwise, you might lose it."

"I want to see that; do you want to try?" Ryan asked.

" Ryan's parents were buried there," John intervened before the arguing could escalate. "You should give up on that region, for now, Ryan. Those who joined the enemies' side headed there and the monsters spawned are also troublesome."

"Good, I will hit two birds with a single stone," Ryan said and immediately disappeared.

Everyone frowned when Ryan disappeared. After all, no one heard of an invisibility spell yet, and Flash couldn't make someone escape from a closed room. Regardless, it looked like Ryan was determined to clear the new dungeon, and no one would be able to stop him.

"Ryan looked pretty resolute" Tristan said. "While I understand he doesn't to let the place where his parents were buried in the hands of monsters, wasn't Dallas nuked? Also, is he going to kill those that joined the monsters' army?"

"Some soldiers investigated the region, and there are no signs of radiation anymore. It is probably thanks to mana," Mark replied. "Unfortunately, it looks like Ryan doesn't care as much as us about taking other humans' lives because he already did so probably more than a few times."

"I find that hard to believe" Tristan said. "I saw him on the first day the monsters appeared, and he didn't change all that much and based on what Daniel and Mia talked about him"

"He did what he did to survive probably," John said. "Even if he hadn't killed a single person, I can say for certain that Ryan wouldn't think twice about doing what he has to do to recover that area from the hands of monsters. Family is a touchy subject for everyone, even more so to those who lost pretty much everyone related to them"

"You should calm down a little bit," Femradiel said. "While I can understand why you are angry, you should have obtained more information about the monsters in the area."

"Are you sure that you can?" Ryan asked, annoyed. "My parents' graves were nuked, they were completely destroyed, I bet I won't even find a precise location of where their bodies were buried, and now some bastards decided to join the fuckers' side and defile even more that land."

"All right, I can't understand it," Femradiel said. "However, you still should calm down. I took a glimpse inside the minds of those guys, and I didn't like what I saw. The monsters this time are troublesome in many ways. You should expect that the bosses and the dungeon master will be much more difficult."

After hearing that, Ryan calmed down a little bit. In the end, he realized that the situation was weird even though he knew that some of the survivors would eventually cause problems, he didn't imagine they would join the side of a dungeon master that just spawned its dungeon a few weeks ago Usually, the monsters would need some time to increase the level of their dungeon. Still, it looked like the opponent this time managed to cause problems and seduce the survivors with sweet words.

" At the very least, that area has four dungeons close to each other, so I will be able to put my other plans in action while I took care of those problems," Ryan said after taking a deep breath. "While the three that existed before were only tier two dungeons, the classes that I will obtain by clearing them will help, even if just a little bit."

Femradiel tried to convince Ryan to rest for a little bit before reaching his destination, but it was useless. Ryan's anger didn't dissipate entirely, and that was making him blind to his fatigue. However, when he finally arrived in the region and saw nothing but a deserted, ruined city completely under monsters' control, Ryan was forced to stop and access the situation. He couldn't only see a single type of monster since the new species probably decimated the others, and the new species was odd in many ways.

"What the heck is that" Ryan said. "They are just too weak."

"But they have some troublesome skills," Femradiel said. "Can you imagine the boss of those creatures and the dungeon master capable of summoning those things? You shouldn't judge the severity of this situation by the level of those monsters."

Ryan nodded at that because he saw the skills the monsters could use, and he couldn't believe that they could use those. Besides, the name was pretty fitting for their figures. Even more than the fake shadows, those specters looked like the physical form of the reaper, and given their skills, it looked like that was pretty accurate. It was kind of hard to believe, but there was a chance that Ryan might fight the physical form of Death inside the dungeon.
