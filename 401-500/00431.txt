Chapter 431: Titanium Storm Long Bow

Chapter 431: Titanium Storm Long Bow

When Ryan opened his eyes again, he couldn't move a single inch. Little by little, he began to recall what happened he cut down Oberon's wings but then was hit by a single lightning bolt. In the last second, he somehow activated Wind Armor and Mana Barrier, and that was probably what saved him, but it looked like his joints had been fried up.

"Woah, you survived that" Femradiel said. "I thought you were a goner, I even stopped fighting since I thought I was going to disappear as well."

Ryan looked around and only saw his new weapon at his side. Aside from that, he could only see the burned ground that the lightning bolts had hit. In the distance, he could see some vermillion birds flying, but Femradiel was keeping them busy. Then, Ryan suddenly began to hear footsteps it was Oberon.

Using the little mana he had, Ryan tried to heal himself, but while his health was recovered, his body still was paralyzed that wasn't good. For some reason, Oberon wasn't trying to fry him with another lightning bolt, but that doesn't mean he couldn't do anything with his hands. Ryan used Telekinesis and forced his body to stand, only to see a half-dead Oberon walking toward him. As expected, he suffered quite a lot, even though he didn't receive a direct hit by his own spell.

"Not bad, king," Ryan said while he raised his sword by using Telekinesis. "You certainly are resilient for a fairy."

Ryan made his sword spin and then fired it at Oberon, but he activated the electric barrier again. The piercing damage and even the power of the explosive effect only made Oberon stagger a little bit. Now that Ryan had recovered a little bit, he could see that Oberon lost an eye and the other was covered in blood that was probably why he was walking toward him instead of attacking from a safe distance. When Oberon finally saw Ryan's shadow from his perspective, he pointed his hands toward him, but then Ryan created a hole beneath him by using Earth Manipulation. Ryan tried to close the hole, but the electric barrier was getting in his way.

"So annoying" Ryan clicked his tongue.

Ryan had an idea when he noticed that the spell was automatic since they were close to each other. That was possible again Ryan created a lot of water around Oberon and then decreased the temperature while it was approaching the boss. Oberon tried to make it go away by using a gust of wind, but he only succeeded in making the ice that was in front of him go away. The thin layer of ice on his sides and back began to melt and cover him in steam while it touched the electric barrier. Oberon started to suffer damage from the electricity as well and thus was forced to cancel the spell.

"This is more like it" Ryan said.

Unfortunately, things didn't become easier after that. Oberon fired several wind spheres that hit Ryan and make him fly backward for several meters. When Ryan finally stopped spinning, he used his sword to block the attacks, summoned a single Magic Bow, and activated Perfect Aim before firing. A single poisonous bolt destroyed Oberon's remaining eye.

"Ugh how dare you" Oberon muttered.

"There is no need to get upset," Ryan said. "This is just a fake body, right? Now, just obediently accept your defeat and become a magic weapon for me."

Ryan prepared to cut off the boss's limbs, but before he could do any of that, Oberon cast once again Thunder Storm Ryan clicked his tongue in annoyance since he had too little mana. In the end, he activated Concentrated Strike and flew toward the monster before hitting his face with his knee. The spell was canceled since the boss finally fell unconscious. Ryan sighed in relief, but he couldn't sit on the ground to relax since he couldn't move his body.

After using enough potions, Ryan used Purification and recovered some control over his body. In the distance, Ryan saw the number of vermillion birds decreasing while others just flew away from the battlefield which was good. He had some time to do what he wanted.

Titanium Storm Long Bow (Stone)

Effect: fire bolts at the cost of seventy-five points of mana that will shock your foes for a set amount of time-based on their Shock Resistance.

Dexterity + 120, Intelligence + 60

Durability: 150/150

You obtained 3.562.100 coins

"Not bad I guess," Ryan nodded to himself in satisfaction. "Wait why did this guy have so many coins?"

The cost of mana was troublesome as usual, but at least the effects and overall power were pretty useful. Besides, Ryan was feeling that he was getting lazy by relying solely on crossbows and automatic shots with the Magic Bow skill. If one wants to keep improving, one has to improve the basics. That being said, there wasn't much where Ryan could improve since he practically knew the number of times he missed a shot.

After thinking for a while, Ryan concluded that Oberon obtained coins by killing the vermillion birds and even his own fairies which was weird. Ryan felt like testing if that was possible, but he was stopped before he could do it.

"If you don't mind, we need some help to prevent the monsters from flying to other areas," Femradiel said. "Things are going well, for now, but it might becomes messy with any misstep."

Ryan sighed he wanted to relax a bit more since his muscles were still sore due to that lightning bolt. Still, he soon rejoined the fight since he wanted more coins and also wanted to make some more magic items by using the vermillion birds. He decided to think that as a necessary job to be done before he gets his real reward: the next class.
